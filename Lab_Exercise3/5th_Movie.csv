"1","The Idea of You","TananaKo","27 April 2024","","I saw this last night at the Atlanta Film Festival alongside a friend who is also in her 40s. We went into it calling it ""the Harry Styles fanfiction movie"" and knowing it was going to be a bit of a fantastical and sexy romp, but we both agreed at the end that we were surprised at how emotional we got watching it. I guess I shouldn't actually be surprised at this knowing that Jennifer Westfeldt was one of the writers, since I'm a huge fan of how she portrays women and relationships. (Kissing Jessica Stein is one of my major cultural touchstone movies.) I'm also a big Michael Showalter fan, but had never really associated him with telling this kind of story before. He gave a Director Q&A after, and I really appreciated hearing him talk about the process of making this, especially with regards to not making Hayes or the idea of being in a boy band a ""joke"" or something to poke fun at.The best part of this movie is the fact that it shows something we rarely see on screen: the idea of a woman in her 40s being found intriguing, sexy, and desirable, and the object of pursuit by a younger, attractive man. The way that it achieves this is nothing new to movies - love at first sight, Solene being the only woman he can think about, and that she stirred something in him that no one else can. This is a common mechanism in female fanastical romances (see also: Fifty Shades of Grey) because, well, it's one of the biggest fantasies we all have, especially for heterosexual women. (Let's hope that it doesn't spawn an epidemic of middle-aged women ""accidentally"" breaking into band trailers at music festivals.) But it does, at its core, speak to a fantasy that anyone who wants to be loved has: that we will be seen for who we are, not for our familial or life situation, the wrinkles on our face, or the birthdate on our driver's license.The other unique thing that the movie portrays is the idea of men being emotionally vulnerable. The way that you see Hayes falling for Solene and expressing his feelings about her is not something you see very often with male leads. Again, this may be a bit of a heterosexual female fantasy, but I think it comes at a time when society is beginning to be more accepting and understanding of the need for men to be able to express their emotions. If you want to know why so many women love The Notebook (another fantastical romance), think about how you see Ryan Gosling's character show just how emotionally attached he is to Rachel McAdams's character. You don't see this in that many movies, but when you do, there's a very good chance that women love it.The film also makes good points about the hypocrisy of society with how Hayes and Solene's relationship is treated, how no one bats an eyelash when male celebrities date women 10, 20, even 50 years younger than they are (ahem, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino), but the idea of a woman dating a younger man is scandalous. This is a point made by Annie Mumolo, who I always love to see on screen, but who is regrettably underutilized here as the best friend character. There is definitely a feminist undercurrent to the movie, including some really cute lines made by Solene's daughter, but it's doesn't hit you over the head with it.Although there are some areas I would've liked to have been handled better, such as the scene where there's tension with the other band members, overall it's a sweet and emotional movie that gives us something I think all women would agree that we want: recognition that we are more than just our age."," Surprisingly emotional and sexy"
"2","The Idea of You","EUyeshima","11 May 2024","7/10","It's hard to believe Anne Hathaway is the same age as Bette Davis as Margo Channing in ""All About Eve"". However, Hathaway truly owns 40 in this 2024 romcom as she plays Solene, a successful Silver Lake art gallery owner still smarting from a divorce three years prior. While taking her teenaged daughter to Coachella, she meets Hayes Campbell, the 24-year-old lead singer of globally popular boy band August Moon. Sparks fly immediately, and homemade sandwiches lead to an extended rendezvous on a world tour. While Nicholas Galitzine fulfills the limited contours of his role as a smitten pop star, it is really Hathaway that delivers the goods giving an accomplished performance that finally adds maturity to her natural effervescence. Directed by Michael Showalter (whose last film was 2022's underrated ""Spoiler Alert""), the movie definitely swerves with predictable plot turns, but at least thanks to the observant script by Showalter and the wondrous Jennifer Westfeldt, it moves with a certain aplomb that makes it watchable. Enough with the Hathahate."," Hathaway Delivers the Goods in a Formulaic Romcom That Somehow Works"
"3","The Idea of You","hannahb-56182","4 May 2024","","Sex and concerts. That was predominantly what this movie consisted of...I didn't mind how the movie began with them accidentally meeting at Coachella in his trailer. I actually thought that, that was a very cute moment. But, the way the movie proceeded from there was extremely rushed. Hayes goes to see Solem at her gallery, calls her hot, and then they start hooking up.And, there's nothing wrong with two people just wanting to have some fun and hook up. However, what I found hard was that we were only shown these sexual moments rather than moments where their relationship builds...emotionally. Thus, making the time they finally say they love each other completely inconsequential. Because as it was, there was nothing that led up to that, that would make that moment feel significant.Truthfully, I was hoping this movie was going to end with them not getting back together, because I think that not only would have been unexpected, but also realistic. In my opinion, these two characters didn't belong together, and in reality, they probably wouldn't have worked. So, I think they could have given us a nice bittersweet ending similarly to the movie, The Breakup. I just feel that it would have been a fresh and unique move to make.Him waiting five years for basically an f-buddy didn't seem genuine.Overall this movie was okay, I did like that they showed the consequences of dating someone in the industry as opposed to glorifying it, and how it affected everyone, not just Solem. But the long, drawn out concert scenes were cringey and unnecessary, and took away time they could have used to incorporate meaningful instances between the love interests."," Where Was the Falling in Love?"
"4","The Idea of You","TxMike","3 May 2024","7/10","My wife and I watched this movie on its first day of streaming on Prime. We expected it to be a lightweight but entertaining rom-com but we were completely wrong. It is much more than that. It examines a number of societal issues, including:The verbal abuse an older woman takes if she dates a much younger man.The role of paparazzi and social media in inflaming a situation.The realities of balancing motherhood and social life.It also plays on one of my favorite themes, the reality of random events determining our direction in life. Anne Hathaway is Solène, a divorced woman just turning 40. She owns an art gallery, she also has a teenage daughter. One day as her ex-husband is about to take the daughter and friends to Coachella he pulls out due to business in Houston, Solène fills in. In another random, accidental incident she goes into the trailer of a well-known, 24-yr-old entertainer, thinking it was the restroom, and meets him.Nicholas Galitzine, British actor, plays the young entertainer,
Hayes. He is a member of a boy band and takes an immediate liking to Solène. Her first reaction is ""I am too old for you."" His reaction is ""I don't care.""This is a well-done movie, the situations and dialog are interesting, the sound track is very good."," Older woman and younger man, difficulties that presents."
"5","The Idea of You","SamoanGenX78","5 May 2024","","The film resonated personally with me as it delved into the complexities of age-related relationships, striking a chord with how societal judgments can shape our experiences and influence our loved ones. Anne Hathaway's performance, as always, was captivating, effortlessly embodying the nuances of her character. Her portrayal added depth to the narrative, earning a solid 7 out of 10 for her remarkable portrayal and the overall execution of the storyline. The cinematography beautifully captured the essence of the narrative, enhancing the viewing experience. The production design recreated the world of the characters, immersing the audience in their reality. Moreover, the emotional impact was profound, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. Overall, Hathaway's adept performance, coupled with the engaging plot, stunning visuals, and emotional resonance, resulted in a thoroughly enjoyable cinematic experience, deserving of its commendable rating."," Hathaway suits this genre."
"6","The Idea of You","rialovesthenotebook","4 May 2024","6/10","Anne and Nicholas both had great acting. Worth the watch if you liked movies like Fifty Shades, and rom coms. However, i do think it was rushed, and not that much plot besides a boy in a boyband,
and a girl who sells art. The romance scenes are good, but it's very fast paced. I wouldn't expect much better than most romance flicks, but the music played is good. I thought it was kinda weird for her to be 40 and him to be 20, and that be the basis of it, i'm not sure what they were trying to do with that as Anne and Nicholas look about the same age and you don't really think of that the whole movie. Not a waste of time movie, try it, you might like it. Critic Review is accurate in my opinion."," Honest Opinion from an Anne Hathaway Lover"
"7","The Idea of You","olcare","2 May 2024","","Due to the high ratings and the high Metacritic score, I was curious and decided to give it a chance. Yes, the movie is definitely not bad, but it's a bit hastily resolved for a 74 Metacritic score, and the real-life drama isn't fully explored due to this speed.First of all, unexpectedly, I really liked the acting and the vibe of the film. I found the allure, sexuality,hot and sensuality of the film to be on point, and I believe this was achieved thanks to Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine. I found the film successful in this regard.Overall, the screenplay is not very original but not bad either, and I'll address its biggest issue at the end.I liked the color palette of the film and the fun, fast-paced scenes during the European tour. It all fit together nicely, and the film didn't fall apart, even though it may not have had a great screenplay. Additionally, I noticed that the film's premise was sometimes unfairly criticized, like lynching in certain places. At this age, we should stop easily judging things that everyone should decide for themselves, like race or choices. We don't have to love or approve of everything, but we should respect others. If you didn't like it very much ,engage with your peers in your own life.Now, onto the biggest letdown of the film for me. The film rushes through the part where it should really throw the audience against the wall when the good story takes a nosedive. This likely has to do with its duration, but it greatly reduces the film's score in my eyes. Because in real life, people don't just get through such cruelty by crying or waiting; life is much harsher and crueler. Moreover, when we fast forward five years, the rush continues and events are easily resolved, which greatly diminished the drama part of the film in my eyes due to these two things.Yes, I know this is a rom-com, but a more dramatic portrayal of such a radical and harsh issue would have made the film more memorable. It's perfectly suitable for an evening movie.Note: In terms of similarity, I watched May December this year, which portrayed the subject matter much more seriously and clearly, but it was also a messy screenplay.Note2: I guess there isn't anything a mother wouldn't do for her daughter or son."," The real life hits a bit different."
"8","The Idea of You","kukupink","8 May 2024","7/10","I've previously read the book, so I anticipated that the movie might not fully live up to my expectations, and unfortunately, I was correct. However, I appreciated how the overall plot was adapted for a faster pace, and both Anne Hathaway and Nicolas Galitzine delivered strong performances. My only gripe is that Ella Rubin seemed too old to convincingly portray Anne Hathaway's teenage daughter; in certain scenes, they resembled siblings rather than mother and daughter, which detracted from the immersion. Nevertheless, the movie excels, particularly in its departure from the book's ending, providing readers with a satisfying closure."," Only one thing"
"9","The Idea of You","renae-00368","2 May 2024","","I am not going to pick apart every detail of this movie. I haven't read the book. I'm not a huge Anne Hathaway fan. But I loved every moment of this movie and how it made me feel. I felt like I was on a holiday from life - I'm not a mother and I'm not yet 40, but I see so many of us living a mundane life, putting ourselves second whether it's for careers or children, and so the excitement of being caught up in the most unexpected fantasy romance is really awakening. I think the lead actors had impeccable chemistry, I enjoyed every little nuance of body language and dialogue (which of course, cannot be perfect, real life isn't perfect!). I will watch this again - thank you for making it!"," Signed up to boost these reviews"
"10","The Idea of You","MyMovieTVRomance","3 May 2024","6/10","Take the 2023 Jennifer Lopez film Marry Me, mix it with the 1999 Julia Roberts film Notting Hill, and you get this movie basically.Good for what it is. But, why do people have to go and make things so complicated, in the words of Avril Lavigne?This movie was pleasant, but also frustrating because the female character was too hung up on her age and what other people thought. Meanwhile, she had a literal Prince charming they're waiting for her, time and time again. All that precious time wasted, worrying over nothing.If anything, this movie demonstrates why people shouldn't let anything get in the way of true love, how silly it is to do so."," Don't throw love away because of other people's ideas of you!"
