"1","The Fall Guy","masonsaul","3 May 2024","","Whatever problems The Fall Guy has really aren't an issue when the final product is this much fun. It's a loving tribute to the never ending selflessness of stunt people wrapped inside of an endearing romantic comedy and meta action film. If David Leitch and 87 North did all the action in cinema the world would be a better place.Ryan Gosling achieves new levels of perfection by merging the reserved stunt man character of Drive with his natural Kenergy. His version of Colt is just so lovable, especially because he's completely unafraid to be open in his vulnerability which makes him more relatable whilst being really funny. His comedic timing continues to be faultless, proving he can make any joke land.Emily Blunt thankfully also gets a lot to do. Any scene she shares with Gosling is effortlessly charming and she has her own brand of bona-fide movie star charisma. Winston Duke is a great movie referencing support to Gosling, Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a hilarious McConaughey impression and Hannah Waddingham's cartoonishly over the top producer really works.David Leitch's direction plays squarely to his strengths and after the disappointment of The Gray Man, it's extra satisfying to see Gosling be given some actually good fight scenes. Stunt designer Chris O'Hara and the whole stunt team really accomplished some breathtaking feats that are only made more impressive by seeing how they shot them during the credits."," An ideal start to the 2024 summer movie season"
"2","The Fall Guy","lord_orsum","30 April 2024","8/10","I enjoyed this film. It was light-hearted fun, the action was good, the chemistry between Gosling and Blunt was believable and the humour was tongue in cheek.The plot is suitably nonsense (as fitting given its 1980s TV origins). Don't think too hard about it. If you ponder questions such as: what about the other witnesses? Can you recover from a broken back to that extent in 18 months? Would he have reported a crime that he was being framed for? When he goes through real windscreens, falls long distances onto hard surfaces, etc., how does he not break any bones? And so on.... well, it will spoil your fun.Kudos to Aaron Taylor-Johnson for playing an absolute arsehole so well. Gosling carries off the comedy better than I would have given him credit for, given his previous work that I have seen. Emily Blunt is always watchable.So grab your popcorn and enjoy the ride."," Don't think too hard about the plot. Really."
"3","The Fall Guy","Geekofriendly","5 May 2024","","Like with ""Top Gun: Maverick"", some witchcraftery was undoubtedly used to shift a thin, generic story into considerably more poignant, refreshing, even warranted territory.I loved ""The Fall Guy"" for what it is! A fun, feel-good blockbuster that knows exactly what it wants to accomplish...and does so in tremendous style that feels as peak Hollywood as a movie can get.Also, it's a much-needed and endearing homage to stunt performers and the tremendous(ly overlooked) value they bring.The movie doesn't miss a beat, it looks gorgeous (the production value is top notch), Gosling's as charming as ever, and the ending felt so deserved and satisfactory that it brought a big grin on my face.What more could I possibly want üòÅ"," The movie cinemaphiles needed and stuntmen deserve"
"4","The Fall Guy","eziukwuuprightness","14 March 2024","7/10","In an era where blockbusters often demand homework, with their intricate universes and complex lore, ""Barbie"" emerges as a delightful outlier. Movies today, from the sprawling epics of ""Dune"" to the interconnected sagas of the MCU, seem to require a viewer's full dedication-and maybe even a notepad to keep up. This isn't to diminish their artistry, but it's clear that the pure joy of cinema, the sort of effortless fun Hollywood once peddled so well, has become a rare find. A film that welcomes you without prerequisites, ""The Fall Guy,"" seeks to reignite that spark of unadulterated entertainment. It aims to dazzle with the sheer magnetism of its leads, thrust into a whirlwind of romance and adventure, harking back to the days when stunts were real and filmmaking was a team sport, offering a joyride that's as heartwarming as it is thrilling.Hollywood's narrative-rich turn hasn't dulled the magic of star power, a fact ""The Fall Guy"" embraces wholeheartedly, reminiscent of a time when the charm of icons like Burt Reynolds was all the spectacle one needed. Ryan Gosling proves his mettle as a jack-of-all-trades, winning hearts even in the most casual settings, his performance in this film further cementing his versatile appeal.""The Fall Guy"" also champions the unsung heroes of cinema: the stunt performers. Through breathtaking feats and daredevil escapades, it pays homage to the risk-takers who've silently shaped cinematic history, although it's not without its critiques, especially in how it sidelines some of its stellar cast in the latter half.Yet, beyond the adrenaline, there's a poignant commentary on the digital age's challenges to authenticity, making ""The Fall Guy"" a vibrant counterpoint to the prevailing trends of faceless, CGI-dominated blockbusters. It's a film that doesn't just want to entertain; it wants to remind us of the value of genuine connection, both on the screen and in the stunts that make us hold our breath. In doing so, it doesn't just invite audiences to have fun; it demands it, championing the kind of cinema that's been overshadowed by the gravitas of today's tentpoles."," A Movie That Appreciates Hollywood Oldies."
"5","The Fall Guy","kobrasec","3 May 2024","","Just back from the cinema and can't remove the smile from my face. This genre of movie has been really lacking lately. Silly, cheesy, action packed movies that are just fun.I'm a fan of the original television show and while this is it's own thing it definitely gives a nod here and there to the 80's. The casting is great, the stunts are brilliant, the plot is fairly thin but hey, it's a popcorn movie. Not everything has to be Oscar worthy.I'd really love to see more movies like this released. Very little CGI, good stunts and just fun. The homage to the stuntmen at the end of the movie was a really nice touch too. Job well done."," More of these movies please"
"6","The Fall Guy","FeastMode","2 May 2024","8/10","The Fall Guy is a movie about making a movie. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays an action star who's stuntman is played by Ryan Gosling... who has a real stuntman doing his stunts. The Fall Guy is filled with this type of third-degree meta-ness. I found it amusing.The intro to the early screening called it a love letter to stuntmen. This is an accurate statement. Everyone who loves movies, action fans specifically, owe so much of their enjoyment to stuntmen. The movie showcases so many beautiful stunts. It truly is a celebration of that profession.This is also heavily a love story. I normally don't go for that, but this one hit me in all the right ways. I felt all of the emotions they wanted me to feel.I think most people will enjoy The Fall Guy. But the ones who will love it the most are people who are fascinated by the artistry of in-camera action, or fans of romantic comedies. Also, we need an Oscar for stunt work asap.(1 viewing, early screening EMX 5/1/2024)"," Movie within a movie, stuntman within a stuntman"
"7","The Fall Guy","chappy-69103","4 May 2024","","While watching this movie, I found myself smiling nearly the entire time. If you are looking for pure, unfettered fun (in the form of romcom action of course), then this is the movie for you. The plot was fun, the acting was solid, the situations that the characters found themselves in were hysterical, the action was on point, the cinematography was nice, and the romance was entertaining. Upon leaving the theater, I couldn't think of any complaints. Again, I was just smiling. Sure, there may be some ambiguities about the context and background of the antagonist's intentions, but I was too involved in the fun to care. 10/10 film."," Pure entertainment"
"8","The Fall Guy","giorgioglobe","14 May 2024","7/10","Well, what can I say?! It's entertaining, but surely not as much as I expected. Ryan and Emily are excellent, what really can't be said about any among the rest of the cast. There is a bit of action, but surely not as much as one expects according to the title and the fact of the movie being based on the old series of the same name. There is also some comical romance, but nothing really too convincing. The last 15 minutes plus the credits showing the ""making of"" scenes to one side of the screen, are the most enjoyable, especially as there are some (somewhat expected) cameos for movie lovers. 6/10 points."," Not as great as one expects, but quite entertaining"
"9","The Fall Guy","nina-matzat","13 March 2024","","Just got out of the Austin premier at SXSW and the whole theatre went nuts for the movie! Emily and Ryan have crazy chemistry and obviously a freaking amazing time shooting this. What a ton of fun!! Its packed with incredible stunts - none of them CGI, its funny and charming and exciting in every second. The camera work is flawless, the cinematography beautiful, the casting perfect, the costumes cool af, they have a DOG!! As a fan of the original series, I loved the movie for its celebration of stund craft and its people. Its a beautiful reminiscence to the original. Defo watching it again when it officially launches. God, I love Ryan and Emily. And thank you so much, David Leitch for making this happen. Seriously. Whatever you touch is incredibly fun to watch. Cant wait for the next one!!!!"," Everything you needed and more!"
"10","The Fall Guy","timothywalton-31924","25 April 2024","9/10","The Fall Guy acts best as a glorious ode to the art of stunt work. Perhaps never before have a film been focused so much on the unseen heroes behind many great films - the stunt doubles delivering shockingly realistic portrayals of the action. And in that respect The Fall Guys succeeds- it's action sequences are delivered flawlessly, and are breathtaking to behold. They climax to a crescendo at the ending, where a several vehicles crash, flip and explode, all in sync with action involving a helicopter in the sky with our main character. Praise should also be given to the films two charismatic leads. Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling share palpable chemistry and are simply endearing to behold. They are affable, amiable, and funny. But ultimately my problem with this film is that it is unevenly paced, lacks enough humour, and has too thin a plot to retain an audiences full attention. The films firstly takes too long to get its plot started, resulting in a laborious introduction, a sped through mid section, and a bombastic but slightly rushed ending. The film also does not exert its full potential of comedy. The film does not make use of action comedy(as best exemplified by the Jackie Chan films) or a particularly witty script. Indeed the script is rather dull, sometimes trite, and altogether not very sharp or exciting. Then there is the films plot. I can comment not much other than that it is the recyclable convoluted B-grade plots which are common in movies. It is predictable, ludicrous, and quite inexcusable. So at the end of the day, The Fall Guys is a good comedy that acts as a wonderful tribute to the art of stunt work, bolstered by strong, effervescent performances between its two leads. But for movie watchers who do not care much for the films impressive stunts, The Fall Guys will prove to be a rather empty watch. Serviceable, but unexceptional."," Thin plot strung over some excellent stunt work"
