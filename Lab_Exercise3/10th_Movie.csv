"1","Abigail","FeastMode","19 April 2024","","Abigail is awesome. It's creepy, fun, thrilling and surprisingly funny. I enjoyed the tone and the music. The fantastic cast plays distinct and memorable characters, with standouts being Melissa Barrera and Dan Stevens. The horror elements are (in Billy Butcher's voice) diabolical. The movie overall is so far from traditional horror flicks and I wish more would go this route instead of the generic movies Hollywood pumps out.The most important thing I can tell you is to try going into this movie knowing as little as possible. Definitely don't watch the trailer. It gives away so much and shows all the best parts. Even for someone like me who doesn't watch trailers, every poster and advertisement blatantly shows something that you don't find out until halfway through.I'll rant about this more in the spoilers section, but whoever is in charge of marketing has no shame. They will hurt the movie for thousands of viewers in hopes of selling more tickets. They are a scourge on the industry.Even if you have seen the trailers, Abigail is still a HIGHLY entertaining movie that I recommend to everyone.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 4/18/2024)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSYou should only read this section if you have seen the trailer or the movie. There is CLEAR intent by the filmmakers to hide the fact that Abigail is a vampire and is the threat they're worried about. They spend the first half wondering who her father is and who he sent to kill them. They start questioning if it could possibly be one of them.All of this mystery is ruined by the trailers and posters. I already knew she's some kind of monster. I spent much of the first half just waiting to get to the part where she starts killing. It was still enjoyable, but I would have been enthralled with the mystery, wondering and guessing what was happening and who the bad guy was. I would have enjoyed it even more.The scene (shown in the trailer) where she reveals she's a vampire, would have, to the full extent of the expression, blown my mind. It would have been one of the most memorable moments of any movie I've seen. The advertising company stole that moment from me and so many others. All so they could make some extra money.But I bet it would have been more profitable if they left it as a surprise. Not only would there be less people annoyed as they wait for the movie to ""get going"" since they already know what's coming. But word of mouth due to that massive reveal would have been huge.They could have advertised this as a mystery, showing them being hunted and arguing over who it could be. It would have been highly intriguing without giving much away. But no, they cater to the casuals to sell a few extra tickets, while ruining it for the loyal horror fans who were going to see it regardless.I wish there was some accountability for whoever is making these trailers. If it was up to me they would all be fired.If like me, you were underwhelmed by M3gan and thought it was far too tame and mild, this is the movie for you. This is what a movie about a young girl killer should be."," Don't watch the trailers!!! (spoilers after a warning)"
"2","Abigail","cyrax-92742","9 May 2024","8/10","This is an entertaining horror movie with comedic elements sprinkled throughout it and everyone in the cast does a pretty good job with the parts they're given but Dan Stevens kills it, he steals the show in every scene he's in, killer lines and he's so damn funny you can't help but laugh. The movie is nothing you haven't seen before but even with that in mind it still manages to surprise you and be unpredictable at times with different twists and turns in the story.Overall it was a solid experience and I would definitely recommend it if you're looking to grab a cold one, kick back and get some popcorn."," Does exactly what it advertises itself as"
"3","Abigail","HerbieStretch","19 April 2024","","There is nothing in this film that you haven't seen in a number of other films but it manages, thankfully, to deliver.It doesn't for my money have as much humour as Ready or Not but does have enough character back story for the audience to know who to support and who to scorn and to emotionally commit to ( as much as you can in a horror flick).You know what is going to happen once the basic premise is exposed and it's fun finding out how and when, and watching the whole thing play out.At the centre of it all is Abigail, played expertly and delightfully by Alisha Weir who exploits this platform to showcase her undoubted talent. She is ably supported by the cast to realise this competent effort and make viewing it time well spent.I believe the film is best watched without prior exposure to the trailer, hard as that is these days, and have also not revealed any content here in that spirit. Enjoy the film."," Alisha"
"4","Abigail","Sleepin_Dragon","8 May 2024","7/10","A mixed group of criminals kidnap Abigail, a young ballerina, and daughter of a powerful business mogul. The gang think they're coming into millions, but Abigail has a shocking surprise waiting for them.One of the horror highlights of 2024 so far, it's done well at The Box Office, and it's easy to understand why, it's definitely a crowd pleaser.A seemingly straightforward thriller very rapidly turns into a genre crossing horror movie. Abigail is a real mix of styles, it's goofy, it's funny, it's well paced, and of course there are plenty of jump scares.Very nicely made, well shot, with some good music, which surprisingly doesn't become too intrusive.You really can't fault any of the performances, credit very much to that young Alisha Weir, excellent as the title character. Melissa Barrera and Dan Stevens are both good, but Weir steals the show.A cheeky And then there were none reference too.7/10."," An enjoyable horror, with some nice comedy elements."
"5","Abigail","gsdpjmcdgw","25 April 2024","","This is fun - almost in the style of Hammer. It's gory, but not scary. A clichéd plot and characters, but directed and acted with enthusiasm, and a good nod to classic vampire films. All the references were there, we were just missing Vincent Price and Christopher Lee and an over-coloured palette.There was a tongue in cheek patina right across the film. I'm not sure why it was rated 18 in the UK - unless to protect people with an aversion to tomato sauce. The gore was done with explosive fun - a real splat fest.This was surprisingly entertaining, done with gusto. Absolutely worth 90 minutes."," A lot of fun - worth seeing."
"6","Abigail","Coventry","13 April 2024","7/10","The Radio Silence collective, and directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett in particular, don't take a lot of time off. After releasing two ""Scream"" sequels in as many years, they're back again with an original tale, similar to (and practically as good as) their previous hit ""Ready or Not"". ""Abigail"" isn't a masterpiece of cinema, nor is it the most innovative or best vampire movie in history, but it's massively entertaining to watch; - especially together with an outrageous crowd of horror fanatics (like I did at the Brussels International Film Festival).""Abigail"" starts off with a clichéd premise. A group of criminals that don't know each other, and each with their own area of expertise, are brought together for a special assignment. They must kidnap the ballet-dancing daughter of a wealthy person and babysit her for 24 hours until daddy pays the ransom. The kidnapping went easy, and the babysitting is supposedly the easiest part because - honestly - what could a 12-year-old girl in a cute tutu do against six heavily armed and professional criminals, right?After the derivative but mandatory first half hour (criminals showing off, traumatic background stories, pinky swears, ...) ""Abigail"" turns into a fast-paced and gore-soaked horror crowd pleaser with funny one-liners and superior make-up effects. The vampires don't look like traditional counts in cloaks, but more like demons with filthy teeth and blood red eyes. There are good performances from familiar faces (Kevin Durand, Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton) and particularly the young Alisha Weir is impressive as the titular monster in her uncanny ballet dress. Good splatter fun, nothing more but certainly nothing less."," Don't come closer, tiny dancer!"
"7","Abigail","PerryAtTheMovies","20 April 2024","","7.2/10 (Recommend)Watching the trailer I did not have high expectations for this film. I thought it would be corny and laughable, but it turned out to be more solid than had been hoped for. It's also slightly different than what I imagined as I thought it was a possessed child over mythological child.There's a good cast with a good range of personalities. They've got good chemistry that allows them to work off each other and add some humour to the film. The characters aren't just random Joe-blows that scream to no end either. They actually work at sorting out the problem in front of them. Alisha Weir (Abigail) is particular good in her role as she flips between sweet and innocent to otherworldly.The cinematography is good. It could be better, but it captures the build-up moments well enough to get heart racing. While nothing is overly terrifying there are moments that may or may not catch you off guard. There's a good amount of violence and blood to make feel like a movie where people die.As the movie finishes up it does get a little weird. The whole time you've got this cat and mouse game where things do happen, but they're drawn out so it feels boring. There's a moment when the action culminates and then the movie ends with both satisfaction and disappointment.In the end I still enjoyed the film. There's good action and decent comedy. I was able to switch off my mind and let whatever happen, happen. It allowed to have fun and get my heart racing a few times. This is a movie worth checking out in theatres. You could rewatch this movie again, but time would have to pass to enjoy it to its fullest again.That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!"," Keep your promises...."
"8","Abigail","trcrock","7 April 2024","7/10","The premise is simple, yet enticing. A group of criminals kidnap a little girl who's the daughter of a powerful underworld figure. Left with this girl as they prepare to collect the ransom from her father, they eventually find out that this little girl has quite the bite to her, and they must band together if they hope to survive the night together.Team Radio Silence have already established themselves as one of the most promising horror collectives in recent memory. Their work in the V/H/S franchise, Ready Or Not, and the latest two SCREAM movies have proven that they are a capable and reliable directorial team. So with this latest film, the question remained: would they keep their winning streak going with this one?Fortunately, this film is a blast and a half. This team have delivered what I'd argue is their best film since Ready Or Not. The action takes a second as the movie develops its central characters and gives us reasons to know them beyond their Rat Pack-inspired names. When the blood starts flowing, though, this movie takes off and flies with absolute gusto! The comedy lands SO many times here, and the actual action/gore sequences deliver in SPADES!The all-star cast excels with this. Melissa Barrera, reuniting with Team Radio Silence after the SCREAM films, shines as the central protagonist. We feel for her and why she does what she does, especially when we learn of her past. Dan Stevens is a foul-mouthed scene-stealer in this, and Kathryn Newton has a number of her own moments here. Giancarlo Esposito and the late Angus Cloud do just as well in smaller roles. The absolute standout, though, is Alisha Weir as the titular vampire. She knocks it out of the park in every scene she's in, and really makes the whole experience worth it.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Check it out with a group of friends when you can, as this movie is best viewed with a crowd. This review comes from the world premiere at the Overlook Film Festival in New Orleans."," ABIGAIL Absolutely Annihilates!"
"9","Abigail","harishnj","20 April 2024","","Okay, be prepared for gore in ""Abigail."" It's not for the faint of heart, but somehow that didn't stop me from being totally into this movie. It's one of those films where you're kind of horrified but also weirdly fascinated.The atmosphere is fantastic. They definitely nailed the whole creepy, isolated mansion thing, which just added to the tension. It constantly had me on edge, always wondering what was going to jump out next.The acting wasn't groundbreaking, but it was good enough to keep me invested. And honestly, the real star of this movie is the little girl who plays Abigail. She's got this unsettling mix of innocence and pure creepiness that works so well for the character.If you're a fan of horror movies that are a little out there, and you don't mind some serious blood and guts, you might just be surprised by how much fun ""Abigail"" is."," Abigail: A Bloody Fun Vampire Flick"
"10","Abigail","XpringlefaceX","24 April 2024","7/10","This could have had a great twist if it didn't tell you in the trailer that Abigail is the bloodthirsty vampire killing everyone. Instead the first bit of the movie is trying to make you guess who is the ""undercover"" one, who is in the house, but it's just Abigail the entire time.....like the trailer said. Okay? Waste of a fruitless plot point.The ""everybody makes horrible decisions!"" cliche.Let's split up while we're being picked off!Let's continue to split up.Let's split up until there's only 2 of us left. Clearly this is working for us.Lambert is a last ditch plot twist. ""Hey, I know I could have just said this from beginning and done this in a way that would have been over in a seconds, and I ALSO know I'm the one in the control and I could just open a window at any point in time killing Abigail, but I thought it would be best to wait until almost all of you are dead, then ask the person I lured in here for help. At night. I want to just fight her 2v1, though we could've just killed her during one of the times she was drugged into sleep, or opened the window when it was daytime, but this is much more dramatic for the sake of the movie!!""""I'm glasses guy, and I suddenly for unknown reasons hate joey now that I'm a vampire, I failed to kill Abigail, she told me where I went wrong, then I failed again! LOL! So I can make Joey a puppet! That I also fail at. I couldn't be a worse last ditch villain than if I were Dr. Drakken from Kim Possible explaining my entire plan to my enemies!""Also I'm tired of regular humans being beaten, stabbed, impaled, thrown through furniture, slammed into walls, and they just walk it off like nothing happened. The last fight scene was so agonizingly bad and long, I was actually getting kind of annoyed in the theatre. The drama of the violence loses all meaning when regular people just won't die from literally anything.Stabbed? Ah well.Impaled? Pull that sucker out and keep going! You'll barely even bleed. We save the buckets of blood for stupid scenes, like getting turned into a vampire over the course of 20 seconds for the projectile vomiting.Broken bones?
