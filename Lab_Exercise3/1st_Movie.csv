"1","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","dam-24421","8 May 2024","8/10","I'm a big fan of all the planet of the apes, and they nailed this one. Usually when they start milking series like this, they come out bad, but with the amazing cinematography and great acting, it more than succeeded. Some movies just deserve to be watched on a big screen, and this is one of them. The movie had me intrigued, and interested in the storyline unlike a lot of other movies I've seen this year. I'm looking forward to what they will come up with after this, and I can assure you that I will be watching no matter what. Go grab a popcorn and enjoy the phenomenal graphics this movies has to offer! Godspeed."," A phenomenal start to another trilogy!"
"2","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","druss44121-1","10 May 2024","6/10","Really wanted to like this. The previous trilogy is excellent, and I'd even say it's one of the best genre trilogies ever made (LOTR is #1, of course). Dawn is especially a masterpiece of intelligent sci-fi adventure spectacle, a movie that is both exciting and intelligent. The entire trilogy is emotionally engaging and Caesar is an incredible lead.Unfortunately, this film doesn't have any characters as good as Caesar. In fact, it feels like a lesser retread of the same ideas and themes of the previous trilogy. There's nothing really new here. You've already seen a better version of this movie before.With that said, let me get the good out of the way first. The cinematography is excellent. The visual effects are still incredible, both as a technical and artistic achievement. The first 45 minutes of the film are really solid. There's a lot of good visual storytelling in the opening act.However, once we meet the main antagonist, things kinda fall apart. The pacing is off. Some scenes drag, while major character moments feel rushed. There's a friction between two major characters that doesn't feel earned, especially since the characters kinda come to an understanding, and then a few scenes later they are butting heads. What could and should have been an interesting dynamic feels incomplete, like entire scenes were cut out.The main antagonist could have been really cool. The idea of a cult-like warlord obsessed with human history, there's so much they could have done with that idea. But he simply doesn't have enough scenes to really make him anything more than Koba Part II. And Koba had better motivations and more complexity. None of the characters here are as well written as the previous trilogy and the last 10 minutes feel more like a TV finale than a movie.Oh, and the music score is pretty generic and forgettable. Really disappointing, because I love the music from the other movies. Caesar's theme is so good. Nothing here comes close.Anyway... Kingdom is far from terrible, but to quote another major franchise with a movie coming out May 2024: ""Mediocre!"""," Not as good as I hoped"
"3","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","bsabillon","11 May 2024","6/10","I'm bummed I didn't love this. The visuals are as good as ever, both from cinematography to cgi it just looks fantastic. Unfortunately it falls flat mostly everywhere else. A classic hero's journey through the remnants of this universe's apocalyptic landscape is a great idea, but the journey itself is just devoid of sauce. It's bland, and often just feels like we're watching scenes checking off boxes from an adventure story. Like a movie coming out of an assembly line. Character motivations are unclear, the mc's emotional arc is unclear, and overall every idea just doesn't feel fleshed out, even when they almost have a good one. How Caesar's legacy is handled in this movie is almost interesting, but again it is not fleshed out. I will say the movie starts strong, I didn't really start turning on it til I realized how bored I was about halfway through. And that's before the third act really just frustrated me. Almost feels like we're seeing the first draft of a potentially great movie. Still excited to see where the franchise goes, but this new set of movies is off to a rough start for me."," Basic hero's journey in a bland entry to a great franchise."
"4","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","thomasgouldsbrough","10 May 2024","6/10","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes isn't a bad film, nowhere near as impressive as the other films in the franchise. Whereas Rise and Dawn had really interesting explorations of the human condition, and presenting human nature as being both inherently selfish and inherently altruistic in an engaging manner, Kingdom fails to present human characters of much substance. The female lead lacks depth, she's just inherently selfish throughout the entire film, even as going so far as to use Noa to get the satellite link.The opening to the film, after the egg scene which was very strong, was a little weak. Caeser strives incrediblely hard to find his oasis, and yet it gets destroyed within the first 15 minutes of the film, in about 5 minutes? It effectively retconned the last film, Caeser's sacrifice was for nothing.The ending is quite good. By introducing the concept of the human survivors, it makes for an interesting way to introduce a new trilogy. Kingdom isn't necessarily a bad film, but nowhere near as impressive as the complexity of Rise and Dawn, or even the original Planet of the Apes and Beneath the planet of the apes."," Doesn't hold a candle to the other planet of the apes films"
"5","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","deason","9 May 2024","8/10","This movie is just about a worthy successor to the original set of movies from the 20th century.Like them, it uses state of the art special effects to wittily investigate contemporary questions of ethics, humanity, status and prejudice while distracting the popcorn crowd with an engrossing adventure of exploration, captivity and escape in a make-believe world that, in what is a strong science fiction tradition, is recognisably a few ""what if?""'s away from our own.Unlike the original five movies, where each sequel was originally unplanned, this is clearly a new ""chapter one"", taking the time to introduce some elements that will feature in the upcoming sequels.Over and over it evokes the sense of wonder of the original handful, with plenty of specific visual, musical and thematic evocations. There are reognisable influences from the 1970s TV show and even some of the Apes comic book stories of that era. But, it is also unmistakably a post-Lord of the Rings epic, the influence showing up in how various action and travel sequences have been shot.While there is not nearly so much sly humour as the originals, the socio-historic themes are more nuanced, closer to the surface and harder to miss. Questions of defining civilisation in terms of laws are answered in a way that will ultimately resonate with modern audiences; a layered and varied spectrum of responses to enslavement is shown; and as expected, anti-monarchist revolutions will always play well in the USA.Non-Americans may roll their eyes a little at the very earnest equating of eagles with capital-L Liberty (one can't imagine Charlton Heston's sardonic and cynical George Taylor from the 1968 movie being very impressed), but on the plus side, Peter Macon's wonderful Raka just about matches the delightful charm of Kim Hunter's Zira and Roddy McDowell's Cornelius from the originals. Owen Teague also does a good job as Noa.The various fight scenes are competent without being overly thrilling (the most exciting action is a cornfield chase vaguely inspired by the original 1968 film), but the deeper probing into the various sub-texts and a fine selection of minor characters keeps the interest levels up. One could pick nits about some of the physics shown in the last twenty minutes, but it's hardly the first Hollywood film to sacrifice strict logic for spectacle and it surely won't be the last.Overall, this does a good job of working on several levels and should appeal to a good range of audiences."," Deeper and nuanced exploration of original themes"
"6","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","brianmcd1-355-272263","12 May 2024","6/10","Are there any directors left that have watched a Spielberg movie so they can see how to pace an action adventure movie? Very few movies are actually so well written, acted and directed as to warrant a 2:30+ hr run time. This was not one of them. But with some proper editing, you could make a tight 2:10 movie that keeps things moving along.The story wasnt bad. The characters werent bad. The acting was good enough. They just took a very long time to get to anything. Then the action picks up for a bit, things get good, it gets exciting and you get another long dull 15-20 min segment. A good editor would bring those segments down to 5-10 min and keep the movie rolling along."," Can we get an editor for this movie?"
"7","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","dinomadaan","9 May 2024","8/10","Greetings from OppositeofColumbus. Like many, I thought the trilogy wrapped up years ago. So when I heard of the next movie, my first reaction was - why? While I liked the trilogy, I didn't think they had been quite the blockbusters to spawn another trilogy, and they had a sombre tone. Nevertheless intrigued, I went for the early screening not having even watched a trailer or read anything about it.First off, watch it on whichever premium format you can. The CGI is really well done from apes emoting to the dramatic terrains.I liked that the hero was a little diffident at first but grew with the story. Sure we've seen it a thousand times, but it was still an identifiable journey.The ideology splits were shown well, the action sequences were effective and the shades of characters kept me interested. Sure it left a few questions hanging, but I guess those are for the sequel(s).Pacing did feel slow at times but I like that personally better than nonstop effects and explosions. Mae was the more intriguing character, with Noa's arc (see what I did there) being a more predictable one. If you let yourself go on the journey, I think you'll enjoy it. No huge surprises in the story though - you'll know if you're gonna like it or not pretty much in the first act. Have fun!"," Sure, a little slow, but nicely done!!"
"8","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","AfricanBro","10 May 2024","7/10","I was waiting just to hear Proximus scream 'WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY!' from all the times I heard the trailer playing at the theatre. I really liked how the franchise once again showcases the humanity of the apes, like the touching funeral scene. It had breathtaking scenery throughout, especially the transformation of metropolitan cities into forests. I found it interesting how they introduced pets, a bird is an ape's best friend, essentially. I liked that we exploring their customs in the first act of the movie.While the film's length and the extensive world-building sometimes made it feel a bit slow, every scene served a purpose in the end, especially considering this's setting the stage for a new era in the Planet of the Apes movies. We get to see how the environment, the apes and the humans have evolved. I liked how the movie paid homage to Caesar without directly continuing his story; his legacy felt respectfully acknowledged. He had a good run and his story was complete.The premise of the movie, particularly the portrayal of the antagonists, reminded me of religious wars, where the apes resemble Christian crusaders using a historic figure's image to justify war and violence, a theme with deep implications. The movie addresses that but not in a way that will make you leave the theatre pondering. How teachings can be misconstrued.This installment's message felt more overt compared to the trilogy, almost as if the apes were portrayed as essentially human. The trilogy was always telling a human story through apes, it was always obvious but now the fourth installment is quite on the nose.Good time is spent with the characters, so when moments of sadness or goodbyes arise, we feel it too. It's slow paced but I was heavily invested. The scene where she calls out to Noah was amazing. Hearing an 'echo' speaking, was almost as shocking when Caesar screamed ""go!"" for the first time. Also was she essentially looking for an English textbook? Lol.While Noah is the lead character, there were instances where Mae took the forefront, causing some confusion about the movie's primary focus. She didn't feel explored or interesting enough but I loved Freya Allan's performance.It's a drama. It's not what I was expecting, I thought it'd me more action packed, but it's still good. It was different to my expectations the way ""War for the Planet of the apes"" also wasn't a full blown war as well. I also think this is the first movie since the trilogy started where earth was now actually a planet of apes. Humans clearly have been dominated.Following up on Caesar was always gonna be difficult, I think he was a beloved character and we got to see his whole journey. The new lead character Noah is alright, however, I didn't find myself super captivated by him. We got to see Caesar's full character arc, birth to death; while Noah is already a little older, coming-of-age age. His story is still interesting though.The conflict of ideas between Noah and Mae could have been more intense. There were times when I thought ""ouu this is about to be a big fight/argument"" and it's just meh. It wasn't as thought provoking as I would've liked. I liked Proximus Caesar though, I thought he made quite the enticing antagonist. Second most interesting character after Raka*.The ending hints at the possibility of another trilogy, laying a solid foundation for future installments. Overall, I liked it more than ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" but not as much as the sequels. ""Dawn of the planet of the apes"" is still my favorite. It's not as epic as I thought it'd be; I think it's more enjoyable if you're already into the franchise. It doesn't do anything terribly, I just didn't walk out of the theatre thinking ""wow!"" People were applauding a lot throughout the movie actually. There was a guy who sat close to me and blacked out before the movie started, snoring the entire time. Thought about not waking him up after the movie finished because everyone literally just walked by him. This dude bought imax tickets, large bucket of popcorn, large soda and some more snacks, all that just to sleep before the movie started. Anyway, I still enjoyed the whole thing, and very much looking forward to whatever's next.Also just found out it's directed by they who did maze runner movies and they actually both have such similar aura to them."," Sequel is probably gonna be titled ""empire of the planet of the apes"""
"9","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","Isak777","8 May 2024","8/10","A great follow up to the last trilogy. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes was my most anticipated film of 2024 and honestly, it's my favorite film of 2024. Not the worst from the Apes franchise but I'll need to rewatch it to decide which one is the best one.I don't really think you need to see the prequels to see this one. Beautiful cinematography and amazing work on VFX. The acting is great too!The film is meant to be seen on a big screen so I would recommend Imax.I hope this film won't flop because it would be a shame.I'm genuinely happy I got to see this one in a cinema because I love the prequels and this is a film that really is made for cinema.I can't wait for the next chapter of the newest Planet Of The Apes trilogy."," A great start to a new trilogy"
"10","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","moviemik-3","12 May 2024","6/10","I don't know if it's just me because in the past 52 hours I have watched all of the Planet of the Apes movies (excluding Tim Burton's horrible 2001 version) but it seemed to me that this movie was just OK.Taking place ""many, many generations"" after Caesar dies, an ape named Noa and his two friends are going through a rite of passage that has to deal with collecting hawks' eggs when an intruder comes into camp breaking the egg he has collected and was holding for the ceremony the next day. Therefore, he needs to go and collect another egg before said ceremony. While he is out, he runs into a band of apes hurting other apes and they track him back to his village, which they decimate and bring Noa's clan into servitude. Noa escapes and seeks out his family and comes across an orangutan named Raka, and they both encounter a human woman who, it turns out, can talk. They are captured and brought to the palace of Proximus Caesar, an evil gorilla who desires to have all apes under his kingdom.While there are many, many nods to the original 1968 film (including musical cues) and the movie had very stunning visual effects, the story itself was kind of lethargic when it wasn't in set piece mode.The acting - with a couple of exceptions - was just okay and this is an indication that future movies need a protagonist that meets the stature of Andy Serkis and Roddy McDowell. Owen Teague as Noa, is barely adequate and the same can be said for Freya Allen as Mae, the talking human. She obviously has ulterior motives, but her performance doesn't. The only three actors in the film that are worth mentioning are Peter Macon as Raka, the orangutan, whose motion capture seems to show his jovial good nature and charm, William H. Macy (yeah! That guy!!!) as a human who educates Proximus Caesar on human history and literature and who radiates the word ""collaborator"" and finally the great character actor Kevin Durand, as big bad Proximus himself. Durand, as he always does, radiates menace.There's no reason that this story could not have been accomplished in less than 145 minutes and it just seems that nowadays the name of the game is to make movies longer for the sake of making movies longer. This movie really dragged, not because of any poor story choices (because the story itself was decent), but because of poor choices in the editing room.I see where this movie trilogy is going and it's fine but is the next motion picture going to be two hours and 45 minutes long and the final movie in this trilogy going to be three hours long? These are Planet of the Apes movies - we're not the defining Pi. The notion that somehow longer is better is absolutely ridiculous.This is the worst of the reboot films since 2011Yeah, watch it because it's not horrible but it could give you a headache (although I may have a headache because I forgot my eyeglasses when I went to the movie theater but, thankfully, I sat in the fourth row and my eyesight isn't that messed up that I couldn't see)If you're into monkeys, WATCH IT - Otherwise, Skip it3/5."," Shorter would have made a big difference"
