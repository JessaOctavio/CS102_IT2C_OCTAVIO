"1","Challengers","malmevik77","27 April 2024","","ChallengersFire and Ice. Best friends since they were 12, Patrick and Art are rising stars in tennis during the senior year of high school. At the US Open, they meet Tashi (the amazing Zendaya who really can do anything) and are both captivated. It is quickly noticed by Tashi that Art and Patrick seem to be more than best friends.Challengers takes us back and forth through time, bouncing rapidly just like a tennis ball crossing the court. When the two men both pursue Tashi, it is very clear that Tashi is the tennis ball during the intense relationship between the two men. She mentions early on that tennis is more than just a game, and boy does this film work those themes hard.The previews left out the fact that LGBTQ+ themes are explored, but with subtlety. The sexual tension between Art and Patrick is so thick, I was left wondering where their relationship was headed. Both men wanted Tashi, but only Art succeeded in marrying her.The tennis metaphor, and the literal matches, fill the movie with excitement and tension that never gets old or tired. Be prepared to pay close attention because of the rapid fire changes between the three leads. I know Zendaya gets top billing, but I still say that she's the tennis ball; being served between Patrick and Art.Also, I have to point out that my favorite soundtrack artists lately, Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch (yes Nine Inch Nails) did the music. They are popping up a lot lately in films, and they never disappoint.This movie was more of an erotic thriller than I thought it would be, because the previews barely touched on the real film. This is a movie worth talking about with friends, so please feel free to engage me. There is a lot left open for interpretation, and a couple of plot holes that weren't filled. One big example is Patrick shows signs of bruising near a vein in his arm. That's an obvious sign of drug abuse, but it's never mentioned other than it being noticed.Highly recommended film. I'm biased because I love tennis, but I'm a sucker when a literal theme is used as metaphor as well. Go see it. And seriously, hit me up afterwards, I'd love to hear other viewpoints, especially about the Fire and Ice."," Tennis as metaphor and very well done. Captivating love triangle."
"2","Challengers","agreenfox","30 April 2024","9/10","Challengers feels like an extremely modern film. It's very playful, and dare I say, sporty in the execution of humor. Everything feels like a little game in this movie. We're not supposed to think the fact that these guys are competing for the same girl is scandalous or the actual conflict of the movie. The conflict of the movie is very much centered on the way they both approach the game of tennis and how Zendaya's character is pretty much the one in control. The boys let her do her thing as she uses intelligence and sexuality to motivate them both. The soundtrack adds to the lightheartedness of the film, and there's no actual big traumatizing moment. It's nice to have such a light, breezy film about tennis that has a great sense of humor and also a ton of depth when it comes to themes like financial security, what happens inside country clubs, and where to go when your uber driver abandons you lmao."," A riot from start to finish"
"3","Challengers","morkoff","28 April 2024","","Forget Match Point, even Paul Bettany's Wimbledon is better. If you are not a fan of Zendaya, I would never reccomend this ""movie"" to anyone. It lacks absolutely everything but occasional beautiful scenery.I remember Zendaya since Shake It Up and although she is a smart and lovely woman with indeniable star quality, her acting has never been convincing. She always positions herself perfectly for the shot, has the needed movement or expression, but it is always with more connection for the camera than with the character (even in Euphoria). I also never found her use of her voice adequate, it is usually one note. It sort of works here because Tashi is a character as flat as a pancake.The two other leads are no better and it is an already very far fetched idea that they would attract the attention of anyone, let alone of someone like the Tashi character.And if this was a movie to attract tennis fans... well it won't. None of the tree leads looks like they have ever played sport. Any sport, any kind, not professionally, just any at all. In school, in the backstreet with friends. The director is either very incapable of his job or hasn't either. They hired Brad Gilbert to consult and help. Ok, but he helps with the wrong aspects. In the end of the day a general viewer would not care if the serve technique is correct, or if the movement and speed is accurate. But he would care about the absolute lack of any engagement with the game. No passion, no desire, no will, no care. Even Ivan Lendl has visibly shown more connection to the game and he was infamous for cool attitude. Or Andre Agassi or Nick Kyrgios who have stated many times they hated tennis. These actors look and act like they are trying not to trip, not to make a wrong move and not like playing for anything (not just the tenmis aspects of the movie). And from this there is no loud enough music to make you care about their game or desires.The music is terrible allthrough, loud and without having any connection with the supposed story. The overly in your face ""metaphors"" are just tiring at this point. Filmmakers might wanna try some new and fresh approach to get the point across. And the overuse of slow motion... it just makes the movie even less.In a time where we care about sparing resources, resources for movies like this shouldn't even be be considered to be spent."," Only works for fans of Zendaya"

There are a couple scenes that could have been shortened without compromising the plot or vibe of the movie.Movie had lots of cool cinematography shots.

Made the climax that much more exciting.I'm not normally a big sports movie person but this one, while definitely a movie about tennis, is more a movie about the characters and their love, passion and what is it that drives us at our core to be competitive.Acting was very good.

"5","Challengers","PedroPires90","22 April 2024","","What I love about Guadagnino is that he never tries to replicate others or do something that can be very forgettable. Even if it's not always easy to see the similarities between Call Me By Your Name, Suspiria, Bones & All and Challengers, one thing is certain: they all have a very distinctive approach and are unique cinematic products.The score of this film is incredible, it's like a whole trip and it evens contributes to make us anxious like we are watching a tense thriller. It is a very sexy film even if sometimes it feels a bit trapped to the Hollywood safe sense of disruption.The trio is amazing and I was the entire time mesmerised by Zendaya, who lives the more complex and nuanced of the three characters. The tennis scenes are very cool and I love many of the artistic choices, especially the creative editing process, not only in terms of the structure but some fantastic montages."," Unique"
"6","Challengers","hibaakr","3 May 2024","8/10","The movie is about obsession and power.When the three characters meet in the hotel room the power dynamics are established, the boys are obsessed with Tashi and she uses sex to control them.While the boys are obsessed witch her, she is obsessed with tennis and all she wants is to watch a good game, her injury stops her dream so now she is only able to indulge her obsession through one of them.Art is easier to control and totally in love with her.This is just masking of Tashis own obsession with tennis, when she tells the boys that she will be with the one who wins just because she wants to watch good tennis.The movie ends with a twist, the boys revive their strong relationship and it does not matter who wins.As she said, tennis match is a relationship."," Everything in this world is about tennis except for tennis, tennis is about sex."
"7","Challengers","jsnyda","23 April 2024","","This movie absolutely FLOORED me. The direction, the script, the music, the ""acting"" (I put quotations there because it felt like real life, the acting was perfect). The way the camera moves was CONSTANTLY fresh. One stop-motion-esque scene in particular --- but PLEASE, just go experience it for yourself. It's better than anything this year and will be bound to become an all time classic. There's nothing even remotely similar to this movie. The all-time most impressive thing about this movie is how at the start of the movie there is little attachment to the characters and then it reveals more and more layers until literally you are at the edge of your seat all the way up to the finish line. Layers and layers until, yes, a true CLIMAX. I don't write reviews, but this movie just grabbed me and excited me about film again. I'm home, sitting on my bed, and my heart is still pounding strong. This makes me want to create something. This is ART. 10/10."," Back and forth, in a trance... 10/10"
"8","Challengers","ztpbrmhw","29 April 2024","8/10","First of all, this movie has an 80s-style vibe that we have seen many times before that could have well been told in a conventional 90-100 minute movie. This movie truly was not ""important"" enough to tell it over 131 minutes. Add to that there were pointless extended shots that you were begging to end. At about 100 minutes in, audience members were looking at their cellphones either to check the time or they were getting restless.Second, there were excessive timeline jumps. It is often a useful story-telling device, but here it was excessive and distracting - so much so that when they did another timeline jump there was a consensus ""groan."" Making matters worse, is that there were time jumps as long as 13 years. However, Zendaya --- bless her heart --- as much as they tried to ""age"" her and ""de-age"" her through hair and make-up, she never looked, to me, older than about 17 years old regardless of the time era.Third, while I credit Zendaya for tackling such a meaty role, and as much as I otherwise adore her, she just simply seemed to young to be so ""weathered"" and ""jaded"" and ""cynical"" and ""ruthless"" and ""calculating"" as she was. Further, I really don't remember her smiling once throughout the movie. And as I have read in other reviews, she seemed to have a resting ""scowl"" throughout the movie - ironically very much similar to the scowl she had throughout both Dune 1 and 2.And lastly, by the end of the movie, none of the three characters were likeable, and, perhaps, oddly, sadly, Zendaya was, to me, the least likeable. And from a film character study point of view, the viewer is never given a reason or backstory for this.With all these distractions in mind, I was so eager for the movie to end that I lost all investment whatsoever in who won or lost in the story's big moment."," Challengers was a challenge to sit through for 131 minutes"
"9","Challengers","olcare","8 May 2024","","I really enjoy high-quality sports movies, but this film uses tennis as a metaphor for a love triangle involving three abnormal individuals in a very accurate way.Let me just say why this film is good. Firstly, it's technically very good. I'll detail the scene I'll say is the best, but overall, the use of cameras, where they stand, and the masterpiece climax in the final scene, make the direction top-notch.The casting fits the script perfectly. Sometimes, it's the actors who determine the tension of a film, and in this film, our trio of leads creates a fantastic tension, very successfully.Thirdly, the use of sports as a tool. In normal sports films, the main focus is on the sport and the plane it creates, but Challengers goes beyond that and metaphorizes tennis very successfully. And tennis could truly be the most individual among individual sports, so it's a very apt choice. The metaphor of the tennis ball being Tashi, especially, enchanted me. The back and forth between Art and Pat, and finally Art winning because of the Grandslam, is not an easy metaphor.Fourthly, and the part I loved, the climax scene is amazing. Taking such a risk in shooting in such a different technique and jolting the audience in the theater with that scene is really well done. Putting the camera in place of the ball, drawing a bomb on the camera, shooting from different angles, all accompanied by a simple music that tells the tempo very well, is really the right move.Fifthly, the film's sexiness is very well placed. The love scenes are not exaggerated and really well placed. Maybe the red-lighted scene at the end is a bit swagger, but all the characters look very sexy. Congratulations to Zendaya, Mike Faist, and John O'Conner, good job.The point I didn't like is that the simple concept of family wasn't filled out enough, in my opinion. When Art and Tashi's child is mentioned, there should have been a flashback to that period and the importance of that in their lives should have been explained. Yes, the film is super-paced and great, but I feel it lacks something, and with a 5-6 minute scene added, the film could have been a 10/10 for me. Also, the focus on Pat's wound. Since we focused on it, we could have had 1 or 2 scenes of Pat's suffering as well.And finally, I want to address people's comments. I think the ratings are exactly what the film deserves, the positives are very dominant, but there are minimal shortcomings, so the ratings are just right. Some people have said (especially in my country), ""oh, we were very uncomfortable, it's exaggerated,"" etc. Dude, the whole point of the film is to try to explain a sick situation; all three characters have big personal problems; one worships people, the other worships sports (and of course, meaningless ambition and success), and the other behaves loosely and cowardly. Sorry, but it's silly to accept this situation as normal and make comments; excuse my bluntness, but watch the movie and try to understand it.The film is very enjoyable and flows excessively, not a second boring, watch it in the cinema.Additionally, some of the argument scenes in the film and the overall structure also resemble a tennis match, I forgot to explain (metaphor) that in my review, but I think this is also a major factor in the film's success. (For example, the argument scene between Tashi and Patrick in their rooms fits perfectly. This fight just like a tennis match.)"," The use of metaphor is spot on."
"10","Challengers","cfballalife","5 May 2024","9/10","The only reason I went to see this movie was to see if Zendaya could hang with the big dogs. To see if she can carry a film all by herself. She has the talent, she has the looks. She has it all. I think this movie is a good start to launch her career as a bonfide movie star. That being said, the movie itself was okay. Just okay. Not great, not bad but okay. I thought Zendaya was good. Her performance was something I expected, which I guess is a good thing. Didn't blow me out of the water but overall good. The actor who played Patrick, in my opinion did a great job. However everything else about this movie just fell short for me.
