"1","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","koltonbrett","15 April 2024","8/10","As a fan of both Henry Cavill and Guy Ritchie, I was thrilled to find an early access showing of this movie at a nearby theater.Ungentlemanly Warfare looked to be a good time, and indeed it is! It's a neat story and they made the telling of it fun. Thankfully it isn't goofy. It's not nonstop jokes, but it has a good sense of humor and I heard a good bit of chuckling in the theater throughout the movie, much of it coming from myself.You can tell Cavill had fun with this role. He shows off some range as his character is very different from the brooding muscle man that many people associate him with. It was delightful watching him do comedy. I haven't seen much of Alan Ritchson's work, but it was easy to see why he has such a growing fanbase. He's the muscle in this movie and proves to be a great action star. The whole cast is great and they give us a lot of fun characters.Action-comedies seem to be Guy Ritchie's specialty. He maintains a good balance of action and comedy and works so well with large casts as he lets every character feel like they matter to the story."," Fun Movie, fun cast!"
"2","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","ghettoplex","23 April 2024","6/10","Let me start with the positives.Like most Guy Ritchie films, the ensemble has great chemistry. Henry Cavill doesn't disappoint, he keeps the pace going and interactions between everyone fun to watch. Alan Ritchson does great as a force of nature, dude is built like a tank. Babs Olusanmokun is slick, he has a very smooth demeanor to his performance. Lastly, Eiza Gonzalez is absolutely beautiful, however her performance was hit or miss for me. But she hit more than she missed.Now, the negatives.The movie doesn't feel like it was even made by Guy Ritchie. Instead it feels like someone else were trying to make a ""Guy Ritchie"" film.I would watch it again, but it is not in my recommendation list if I were to convince someone to get into Guy Ritchie films."," I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either"
"3","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","jblippman-150-589854","28 April 2024","6/10","I guess when you set out to make a film based on a true story-- not inspired by, but actually based it-- you're constrained by events.Unfortunately, there wasn't much tension or ever a sense of our heroes having met their match.The dialogue was occasionally clever, and the acting was ..fine. Not a lot was asked of this talented cast. Also, as often happens with ensembles, we really only get to know our characters on the most superficial level. (Ensembles need franchises to tease out individuals' personal stories). Hard to be invested in their survival.And finally, what a waste of Henry Cavill. Cavill has a great face for this sort of role. Smirks, frowns and grins were swallowed up in a curiously overgrown mustache and beard. Why hire That Face and then hide it completely? Similarly, he spends the entire film, bundled up in multiple shabby layers of clothing. We're they trying to hide his physique so he wouldn't look too much like his costar Ritchson? Not a problem as Ritchson has at least 3 inches and 25lbs of muscle on Cavill any day of the week.They could have hired any one of a dozen other actors for the role if they didn't plan to let us SEE Cavill. And paid a lot less for them.I came away annoyed by the promise of Cavill unfulfilled and by a storyline that wouldn't have made for an interesting episode of The A Team.But Alan Ritchson was great. He clearly had way more fun with this character than he gets to have with Reacher."," Some charm but no heart."
"4","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","mark-67214-52993","27 April 2024","7/10","Guy Ritchie's ""Ungentlemanly Warfare"" is based, kinda, on the true exploits of Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II. Unsurprisingly, given Ritchie's involvement, liberties have been taken with the story.The SOE existed to operate behind enemy lines, committing sabotage and various other acts considered ungentlemanly by the upper crust officers who ran the conventional army. In 1942, England was starving and its army could not be resupplied because German U-boats owned the seas. With the blessing of Winston Churchill, the commander of the SOE sent a team to destroy the Duchessa d'Aosta, a supply ship that supplied all the carbon dioxide filters for the U-boats. These filters permitted these submarines to remain submerged for prolonged periods. By disabling the supply ship, the U-boat fleet would be effectively sidelined. The mission was labelled Operation Postmaster. It took place in January, 1942. This story centers on the real characters - Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), Anders Larssen (Alan Ritchson) and Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer) - who were sent to complete this mission. In this film, some totally fictitious characters and other amalgamations of real-life participants also tagged along.""Ungentlemanly Warfare"" contains all the satisfying flourishes of a film by Guy Ritchie (""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""Sherlock Holmes,"" ""The Gentlemen""). This film is cool and stylish. It's filled with swaggering characters spouting cheeky dialogue. There are flashbacks to keep the moviegoer off-balance. There are first-rate set pieces/action scenes. Oh, and there's violence - lots and lots of violence, most of it gratuitous. Did I mention the violence? The entire package is delivered with a manic gleefulness that's contagious.While the story is ""based on true events,"" reality is just a jumping off point. This film suggests that a major role of the operation was to persuade an officially neutral US to enter the war and begin helping Britain. Pearl Harbor occurred the month before, so the US was already fully engaged. The film also suggests that by disabling the supply ship, the SOE's mission could change the course of the war. While the events depicted in ""Ungentlemanly Warfare"" were not unimportant, a bigger factor was the development of RDX, an explosive powerful enough to sink the U-boats in the open sea.The film offers an interesting side note. One of the staffers for the SOE depicted in the film is a young officer named Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox). Yep, that Ian Fleming. His boss was known as M. In his James Bond novels, Fleming incorporates the character of M. Fleming has noted several times that the character of James Bond was based on Gus March-Phillips.To summarize, the cast here is charming and appealing, in no small part because they appear to be reveling in their madcap roles. Some of the location shots (much of the movie was filmed in Antalya, Turkey) make the film as worthwhile as a NatGeo documentary. The ""true story"" is a muddled mess. And there's the violence, lots and lots of violence. (Historical note: no one was actually killed during Operation Postmaster, although one Nazi soldier fainted at the sight of the intruders.) Guy Ritchie's energy and enthusiasm, which permeate this piece, will win over a lot of the folks in the seats."," Great Guy Ritchie Insanity"
"5","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","markdv-19","20 April 2024","7/10","This was a very fun movie with satisfying action scenes. The action scenes can be over the top at times but it does not feel like a movie you need to take super seriously. I enjoyed every scene with the core five actors.The movie does drag a bit in the middle of the movie. This is based on a true story so I get why it's important to see all the parts of the operation. However, there is a lot of dialogue and slow pacing in the middle. It focuses a lot on what I would consider the B plot.By the end of the movie it ramps back up and you get a satisfying climax with all the parts coming together. Overall very fun laid back movie, especially if you are interested in history and WW2."," Fun movie with a little drag in the middle"
"6","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","Ryan331","16 April 2024","6/10","The movie is fun for the most part, but not the strongest Ritchie film. The trailer is a great representation of the film - the cheekiness, costumes, violence, and Henry Cavill's twirly mustache. If you liked the trailer, you'll probably enjoy the film.I do think the movie could've been a lot more but was bogged down by the ""true story"" aspect. There are a few scenes that felt very Tarantino-esque in its hyper violence or intensity, but likely couldn't be taken further because of the limitations of a true story. While not mad at the casting, they could've skipped on giving Alan Ritchson the crappy danish accent. And when Eiza Gonzalez's character's ethnicity is introduced, you'll probably raise an eyebrow considering she's a Mexican actress."," WW2's Oceans 11"
"7","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","rwhnd","16 April 2024","9/10","The movie is a beef cake sandwich crammed with testosterone and rippling biceps-- Henry Cavill and Alan Ritchson have wonderfully comedic and sincere chemistry as they chew their way through Nazis.Guy Ritchie's sensibilities are on full display-- sharp transitions, character introductions, banter worthy of Tarantino, and charm. Spiritually this film feels like a violent successor to The Man from UNCLE despite it being set decades prior. The plot is straight forward and allows for a talented cast to stretch their legs.I certainly hope this movie leads to larger action roles for Ritchson who has been stellar to date."," Violent, Exciting, Fun"
"8","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","darkreignn","15 April 2024","7/10","Cinemark has brought back its Secret Movie Series, and having never been to such an event before, I found myself intrigued and, for the low price of $5, I simply couldn't resist buying a ticket. I was one of six people in the theatre - clearly, a secret movie experience is a hard sell. However, I was excited at the prospect of watching something without knowing exactly what it would be. And after the trailers concluded, the lights dimmed and the film began to roll - to my delight, the secret movie was ""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.""As a Guy Ritchie fan, after having seen the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it - although, admittedly, I didn't think the trailer was especially striking. However, I like Ritchie, and I love Cavill, so I was pleasantly surprised at the reveal of this film being the secret movie. And you know what? This is actually a pretty fun flick.Yes, there is nothing too innovative at play here - this is standard Ritchie fare, except more nuanced and less extreme in its directing and editing choices than, say, Ritchie's King Arthur film. ""Ministry"" plays out more like a typical action adventure movie with flares of Ritchie's signature style coming out here and there; and this more subdued approach actually works to the movie's advantage to highlight some of the more dramatic and intense moments. But if you're going to see this film, you're most likely going to see it due to the action that the trailer promised you. And how is the action? In a word: Great.My only complaint about the violence in this film - not to sound too bloodthirsty - is that it is surprisingly bloodless for an R-rated movie. I was really expecting something akin to Quentin Tarantino, with huge spurts of blood and gory deaths, but Ritchie, once again, takes a more subdued approach, choosing not to showcase a lot of blood or grisly images. That said, the action in this movie is still FANtastic, playing out an intensity that is simply missing from most modern action movies. There are plenty of shootouts - both with guns and with arrows; there are knife fights and axe battles; there are hand to hand combat sequences; basically, all of the WW2 action you can imagine is in this movie, and it's filmed wonderfully, without shaky camera or quick cuts. Sure, I would've preferred a bit more blood when Nazi's were punched or shot or sliced, but I can't knock Ritchie for choosing not to include that for the sole reason that the action is filmed so freaking well. It's nice to watch an action movie that has two things: 1) a lot of action and 2) clearly filmed action. Luckily, ""Ministry"" has both of those things, and because of that, will be sure to satisfy even the most jaded action junkie.In Ritchie films, both the plot and the actors are always standouts, and it's no different here in ""Ministry."" Cavill and his band of ungentlemanly warriors are all super entertaining to watch, their chemistry leading to many laugh out loud moments. Additionally, the plot - as IMDB puts it, ""a small group of highly skilled soldiers strik(ing) against German forces behind enemy lines during World War II,"" offers a lot more meat to chew on than you might expect. There are a lot of things happening concurrently, which leads to storylines converging in a pretty satisfying way. There are also a few unexpected moments that force the plot to go in directions I didn't expect, but certainly enjoyed watching. The plot isn't anything phenomenal, but it kept me engaged and was a great vehicle for its characters and action.""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare"" is a good time at the theatre. This doesn't necessarily offer something that you haven't seen before, but in a genre as tired as WW2 action is, ""Ministry"" shakes things up just enough in terms of its colourful characters and explosive action that you can't help but have fun watching this. And if you're a fan of Guy Ritchie? Then going to see this is really a no brainer."," Colourful Characters and Well-Filmed Action Injects New Life into the WW2 Genre"
"9","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","malmevik77","15 April 2024","9/10","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly WarfareThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a true story set in World War II. The story was largely unknown to the public until 2016 when documents from that era were declassified.The dramatized narrative does have its silly moments, as shown in the previews, but the story is nothing but. Had these brave men and women not completed the mission, there is a chance Hitler would have won the war.If you wish to see arrogant Nazis get shot, blown up, tortured, stabbed, or otherwise maimed, then definitely go see this movie. It was most satisfying to see as many of them hurt as possible. Even knowing that the Germans lost the war, I was on the edge of my seat during the covert action, but also laughing out loud while they perform said action.There are so many movies made about World War II that I was very pleasantly surprised to see one that I knew nothing about. I know this was intentional as the operation was classified. So many acts of bravery and heroism still continue to not see the light of day, and I cheered (along with the rest of the audience) at the conclusion.It's very much an R rated film, but this is one that everyone should see. So much could have gone wrong throughout the entire war that life today as we know it would be so different. Always remember that the war didn't just last 6 years, only direct combat. This had been going on for decades, and the lessons learned afterwards must still be repeated."," A well done film based on a true story"
"10","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","artistwriter-54705","16 April 2024","6/10","Saw this at an early access showing. It was not what I had hoped, but more or less what I expected. If you like movies based on Historical events, that seem to also show the connection between new film franchises, and old, this is a pretty good film for that.You have Henry Cavill walking through the entire film, with zero sense of urgency. You have the poor man's Gal Gadot, who does nothing but act as eye candy and a distraction to both the on screen talent, and the audience. You have Alan Ritchson who more or less steals the entire film as the lunatic killing machine. Honestly everyone does a decent job but frankly you could have cast anyone in this movie and it would have turned out the same.I like some things I have seen by Guy Ritchie, but this movie is a little less interesting because everything is so bland and safe. Visually, it's okay. It's not great. There were some good moments in the movie and some funny things that happen, but you can see where the moment lingers and the tension is not there at all. That's the thing. I did not feel one bit of tension for anyone at any time in this movie.That's the real sad part about this film, as you don't care about anyone before, during or after things get rolling. There's no air of menace to any of the bad guys, there's no chemistry between any of the characters. You see some glimpses but it's one scripted scene after another and there really is no acting.Why should I expect more? It's not like anyone is producing any really compelling films that make history interesting."," With an All Star Unutilized Cast"
