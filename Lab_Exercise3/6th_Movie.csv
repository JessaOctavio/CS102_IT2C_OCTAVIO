"1","Mother of the Bride","helmahvg","11 May 2024","","I don't know if I actually hate this movie or that I just very much dislike it. What a horrible storyline and so unbelievable. I think the only decent thing I have to say about it is that the quality of the shots is actually quite allright.The actors who were supposed to be mother and daughter and who were supposedly father and son felt nothing like it. I don't have anything against the actors, they just did not match at all. They felt like the more believable relation towards eachother would have been as friends, but just with an age gap. And how weird was the story; all the events happened within seconds and the bride said her mother was a piece of work but they could not be more lovely people. There was no real-life drama and no trauma (good for them).But finally; how weird and how horrible would it be if your mother and father-in-law got engaged. I could not see the fact that my mother got a relationship separate from that my mother is dating my husbands dad. That's just too much."," Just too awkward"
"2","Mother of the Bride","stephensdelicia-95654","10 May 2024","4/10","I usually like light rom-com movies but this one was not all that great. The setting were it took place was beautiful but the movie didn't use enough of it. I thought the acting in this was very wooden and some of the dialog was so cringe worthy. Booke Shileds looked really good for her age of being almost 60 but, something about her eyebrows really bugged me. Benjamin Bratt as a 60 year old is still very cute. I know this was suppose to be a comady but I didn't laugh at any of it. I was glad to see Star Trek: Discovery's Wilson Cruz in the movie. I think he is a good actor. The movie was only good for a one time watch and I would never watch it again. It's a type of move for when your bored and don't have anything else to watch."," Another silly Netflex movie"
"3","Mother of the Bride","lisafordeay","9 May 2024","","Mother Of The Bride is a 2024 romantic comedy starring Brooke Shields(A Castle for Christmas),Miranda Cosgrove(I Carly),Benjamin Bratt(Miss Congenality) and Chad Michael Murray(A Cinderella Story).Directed by Mark Waters(Freaky Friday,Just Like Heaven),the story follows a doctor named Lana Winslow(Shields),who finds out that her only daughter(Cosgrove) is getting married to RJ. So both Lana and her daughter travel to Thailand where Lana gets the shock of her life. She discovers that her daughters future father in law is no other than Will(Bratt),the man that broke her mom's heart during college. Will romance blossom again?.Overall this film was so so. The actors were good,but the concept was just weird. If the two main leads get married then that means that they are now step siblings since Lana and Will get together."," A predictable movie with some famous faces"
"4","Mother of the Bride","susiegaynormcgowan","12 May 2024","4/10","When you watch a rom com you can nearly expect what's going to happen, this is no different. However the plot is utter ridiculous even by rom com standards. Most of the actors have no chemistry and the production is choppy to say the least. Brooke Shields isnt bad, Rachael Harris (Lucifer) has some good lines, Wilson Cruz (Star Trek Discovery) has some good lines too. Miranda Cosgrove and Sean Teale (the bride and groom in the movie) have zero chemistry. Im not even sure why Chad Michael Murray's character Will was even necessary for this movie. The best part of the whole film is the beautiful scenery. Most of the film is utter cringeworthy stuff. Save yourself 90 mins and watch something else."," Even for rom com lovers this is terrible"
"5","Mother of the Bride","klauzbiomed","10 May 2024","","I knew it was a predictable movie, but the script and the acting is so bad executed that it becomes impossible to buy the story. There isn't chemistry among the actors. The bride and the groom seems like friends or strangers, and the relationship between Brooke Shields and her romantic interest doesn't work at all.Everything fells like a bunch of prefabricated scenes glue together with poor edition. In my opinion this is the problem of Netflix, they don't wanna take risks. Just go for familiar faces with terrible scripts and poor acting. It could be a nice return for Brooke Shields, but it was disappointing to me."," Poor acting"
"6","Mother of the Bride","terrylarosa","10 May 2024","5/10","After suffering through Anyone but You that was as unfunny as you can get we get another massively unfunny rom com. Brooke is brittle, overbearing, doesn't have any comedic chops and showing she's not a good actress. Was she ever? This was awful beyond belief. It's been years since I've seen a good rom com. Avoid at all costs. It gets one extra star for some of the locations. Made it halfway before I couldn't take anymore. I have to keep writing. If I could just keep one soul from seeing the travesty then I've done my due diligence. FF to the wedding and even that was awful and robotic. Whew made it."," Another rom com nightmare"
"7","Mother of the Bride","Ina_L","10 May 2024","","This movie is nothing special one tipical romantic comedy movie that fallows two couple stories that are connected, but it is mostly focused on second chance trope. It has great cast but some dialogues and scenes feel like they were suddenly cut. A lot of different stories were started then cut out of nowhere and where replaced but new/old ones. Too many stories have been started and wanted to tell but none of them have been told properly. There are some cringe dialogues and because of that you cannot feel the chemistry between the actors. The last scene should be done better and in different way."," Nothing special"
"8","Mother of the Bride","hiside-64664","9 May 2024","3/10","We are the generation who were born in an era of blue lagoon so for us Brooke was a goddess and we keep checking on her from time to time like that Christmas movie she did last year and I'm sure many are proud of being of this generation.You keep watching the movie although being predictable and I think deep inside people just remember the good movies era along side remembering Brooke.The movie got some laughs and goofy situations and you can easily say it is a cute movie to watch with your girlfriend and popcorn and then forget it and just remember that poster on Brooke in your room long long time ago."," Enjoyable"
"9","Mother of the Bride","bekki-04079","11 May 2024","","This is a poor written script with a cringe worthy script. The acting was poor and storyline was more about old lovers (who's kids are marrying each other) than the wedding itself. I rated this 2 out or 10 as it was boring and badly done, no comedy (they tried) and all about an influencer wedding. The costumes weren't great. The mother of the bride was awkward and played the role badly. I would avoid watching this film if you're looking for a fun comedy as it is definitely not that. All set around the bride and grooms parents awkward past to reuniting at the end at their children's wedding (not appropriate) Avoid this weird film."," Cringe - not funny"
"10","Mother of the Bride","MickyG333","11 May 2024","1/10","6.9 stars.This isn't bad and it's certainly not 4.9 stars bad. Is Netflix lying when they say this was #1 on their movie list this week? It doesn't have too many reviews and the rating is way too low for a #1, so I'm confused.It's a decent rom com, Bratt and Shields have good chemistry. For two people in their late 50's they look really great. I will do my best to look that youthful when I get there, which isn't far off. Both of them have physiques of ripped 35 year olds, young looking faces, good all around health and tone.The movie is generic. It's about a destination wedding on a tropical island resort, the whole family is there - not too many members. CMM is a supporting hot younger guy who is trying to get with Shield's character. Bratt's character is trying to get her attention again, to win her affections the way he had her 30 years ago in college. Meanwhile her daughter is marrying his son. There was history between several of the fifty something group - they all went to college together, lots of memories and drama.Not a bad story, so I'm perplexed at the low ratings. Not great, sure, but entertaining enough."," Netflix propaganda?"
