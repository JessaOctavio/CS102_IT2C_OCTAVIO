"1","IF","pvqpmwgnj","13 May 2024","","This was a visually stunning and whimsical movie. It had a star studded cast with Ryan Reynolds, John Krazinski and Steve Carell. In fact it could have done without a star playing the dad I thought, as this detracted from the emotional opening scene. The movie felt boring at times for the first two-thirds, despite the interesting concept of the story; I think it lacked suspenseful direction in the plot development. Ryan Reynolds had about three great funny moments, all of which are in the trailer, and it's a shame he wasn't able to bring a bit more of this well known personality into the film throughout. The last third was definitely the highlight of the movie and did get more exciting and definitely heightened the emotion of the movie."," Beautiful movie but..."
"2","IF","cthirlby","17 May 2024","6/10","Harmless and wholesome family fun. Pretty simple and heartfelt story for the kids. It has some great cast members mostly with the voiceovers but they are in it, not as much as I'd hoped but they are there. It's a very imaginative film with a few cool fantastical scenes, particularly the dance number in the imaginary place. Reynolds didn't really shine as much for his personality and wasn't as funny in this but still a good presence. Cailey (the girl) being from the walking dead too seems to be doing well for herself being put in a Krasinski and Reynolds movie. Sometimes the film lacks and the story gets weak in the middle but overall you can understand it. The ending is probably the best part as it has the most weight to it and emotion about what imaginary friends are and what they do and mean for us. Also a nice little surprise of an ending if you didn't see it coming. Overall just a good family film but could've been a bit better."," Harmless family movie"
"3","IF","brattybecky","18 May 2024","","My youngest daughter wanted to see this, it has Ryan Reynolds in it, so I thought ""what the heck"". Man I did not anticipate that I would be a bumbling crying mess at the end of this film.I wouldn't say this is a kids film, it's more of a film for adults who still have that child still inside of them, but they lost their way when they grew up and became adults. This is a movie for the child inside all of us, that still has that glimmer of hope.John Krasinski seems like a big child, and that's basically what he was playing in here. I don't mean that in a negative way, I find it very endearing because you don't see that a lot anymore in people.I really liked seeing the imagination of the little girl in here, but as I stated this is a HEAVY movie, so some things kids may not enjoy in here. When we got out of the movie I asked my daughter ""did you like the movie?"" and she said ""yeah, it was funny and sad"". I would have to agree with her assessment.I would say that if you have a child that has trouble concentrating or sitting still, then they will be miserable in this. This is definitely targeted more for adults."," Why did you have to do that?"
"4","IF","jaredwillmer_333","11 May 2024","6/10","I must admit, the first half hour had me questioning if I was wasting my time. I was confused about the vast demographics the film was trying to appeal to. Maybe there could've been some improvements there.Once the 2nd act started, I slowly started to find myself more and more invested in the characters. However, I was still questioning potential plot holes in the story and the films demographic.During the 3rd act, it really tied itself together and started to make a lot more sense. I want to rewatch it knowing how well it ends, similar to a Christopher Nolan film. I'm curious what a child would think of this film because it deals with some adult themes and subject matter that only an adult would relate to. It isn't crude, it's very family friendly. A child might find it slow and boring at times. The moral of the film might go over a child's head but there's plenty of humour and subject matter aimed at children.Overall, I was very impressed with this film, and I'll be watching it again. Take your kids to it. If they don't enjoy it now, it'll definitely have a completely different meaning to them in 10, 20, or 30 years. As an adult, you'll almost definitely enjoy it."," 30 year old male perspective"
"5","IF","carlirealtor","18 May 2024","","Before you go see this, be prepared on what it is and what it is not. We are a family who lost a child to cancer, so when the movie started the way it did, I automatically wanted to walk out because I thought I was taking my family to see a ""funny"" movie. My daughter cried many times and kept saying ""mommy, why didn't you tell me this was a sad movie?"" There were also plot holes and scenes that didn't seem to have much to do with the film. For example, what was that scene in the retirement home with that sad cat? I wanted to know who the cat was and we never got to see. Why were we even shown that sad kitty to never have him shown again? I had assumed something good would happen to him. Also, every time the little boy said he could not see an ""IF"", my daughter cried because they were all so desperate and they were being rejected yet again. The acting was well done but I was confused on who the target demographic was. I heard lots of kids asking questions during the film so be prepared to talk about tough topics after the film is over. It was a good film, but it was quite sad. Just don't go into this movie hoping for a ""Minions"" type comedy. You have been warned."," Here is your trigger warning!"
"6","IF","a-clinch1","18 May 2024","7/10","Really hoped that this would become known as a family classic. I took two thirteen year old boys and both thought it was average at best. Effects are good but there was a serious lack of jokes. A film that will not live long in the memory. Cast is great, film also looks great but there was no sense of excitement at any point. Quite flat throughout the whole film. Felt like the film is aimed at children under ten but I think that age group will also struggle as it just has no magic. Needed alot more jokes, less schmaltz and some excitement. Waste of a very good cast. I really did want to love this film."," Not as funny as I had expected"
"7","IF","meredithentler","11 May 2024","","I'm offering a huge standing ovation to John Krasinski and the entire cast of IF! This movie is magical, heartfelt, beautiful, and the kind of film that will stick with you forever. The casting is perfect.I am a 48 year old mother of two, and all three of us left the theater with a sense of awe and wonder. I am also a mental health therapist, and I can clearly see how this movie can Serve as a highly effective tool for use in groups, as well as individual therapy. This is the type of material that illicit emotional responses that can set the stage for highly effective individual and group process. It is one that I will be incorporating in my own professional practice, and I encourage other therapists to do the sameFor the teachers, this film would be a wonderful addition to social emotional learning programs. The message of the magic of childhood, resiliency, and community is undeniably effective.I cannot wait for this movie to be released for purchase because I will be buying it on day one and re-watching this over and over again. I will confidently go so far as to say that this movie is the Mary Poppins of the day."," Pure magic!"
"8","IF","imtiaziqbal-75662","18 May 2024","6/10","Imaginary Friend is a movie likely to appeal to kids and some adults as well. I admit the movie has an interesting concept which could have been made a bit more interesting and happening than it turned out to be.John Krasinski teamed up with his old pal Ryan to make this family friendly movie after A Quiet Place but the movie takes quite some time to take off and mashes up what could have been a more fun and action filled fantasy adventure rather than just an emotional rollercoaster.Some of the IFs imaginary friends, although colorful and happy, could have been used a tad more and could have made this movie more adventurous and funnier than it turned out to be."," Could have been Better !!!"
"9","IF","crpenman","11 May 2024","","The majority of this film I was questioning this film, I won't lie. The messaging seemed all over the place, the target demographic similarly seemed to vary scene to scene. There were a bunch of grin inducing moments and some good laughs, but I was frustrated by the film's lack of commitment to answers or internal logic, why certain things are important etc. I was very impressed with some of the acting, John Krasinski and Fiona Shaw are delightful in particular and the stacked cast is a wonder of ""I know that voice"" all of which are charming. But it seemed the key function of pairing imaginary friends with kids to be a very child friendly line. The way it takes it in reality is far more adult while still being a little confusing. I got about 70 minutes into this film and started wondering why, if anything other than a 1 sentence summary John Krasinski and Ryan Reynolds had said this was a live action Pixar film.The ending and the subsequent hours of reinterpretation and pondering leave me in awe of its execution. I still think there are problems, and scenes that feel very haphazard in some ways, and I still feel some bewilderment over a film that takes 90% of its run time to come into its own. It's a fantastic twist, and similar to Gone Girl (an odd but apt and well considered comparison given that to mention any others would constitute a spoiler) is one of the best examples of a twist impacting your entire viewing experience, I've ever seen. Everything crystallises and the amount you get from it as a young adult increases exponentially-I can only wait and look forward to how its meaning and poignancy will change throughout the rest of my life as the best Pixar films do."," The Ending saves this from being an interesting thought experiment"
"10","IF","josh-81494","17 May 2024","6/10","This film was advertised as a very creative kids animated movie, and it is that in parts, but very slow and lots of drama, perhaps more for Parents? Parents, bring tissues, you will cry. Folks who arent parents might not get much out of this. Problem I have with this film; What grandparent would let a 12 year old go to Coney Island every day solo from Manhatten, without communicating until dinner time?!? There is not one phone in this film, Not in this day and age. Some parts of this film are very trippy, well animated, and when its in that zone it is super fun, but it gets back to drama, and there are parents both dying and sick, and it is a tearjerker at 3 points in the film, including the opening credits. Young kids will be bored, preteens will be entertained enough. I asked my 11 year old if he ever had an imaginary friend and he said no, I said me neither. He said it wasnt bad but he was expecting more animation. This could have been better with less hospital and more roger rabbit style scenes. They made a high budget well made drama with excellent cgi animation. It has lots of Heart, 6/10."," Emotional rollercoaster, bring the tissues"
