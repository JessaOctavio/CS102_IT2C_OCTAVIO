"1","Megalopolis","brettkdobbs","4 May 2024","","Maybe I built up ""Unfrosted"" too much, in my mind. When I heard about this movie, I got excited. And when I saw the cast, I nearly hyperventilated. But, when I finally watched it, I fell asleep.This movie had so much potential and it had some really funny moments. But it lacked so many elements that make a great comedy movie. It needed frosting.The look and feel of the movie was retro and bright and cool. It had a ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" vibe with a quick and witty script, snappy interactions, and a very intentional pacing. What it was missing is heart and moments that make you care about the characters. It was as if they made a script out of one of Seinfeld's bits (which they sort of did). It was like one long joke that never paused to let jokes land or slowed to build a connection with the audience. It was as if it was written by a first time director and screen writer (which is also true). This movie needs to go back to the creators and be re-written.There are comedy and acting icons in this movie. I wish someone had stopped to ask them for their input on the scenes they were in. Or, watch season one and two of ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" and follow that blueprint.""Unfrosted"" felt rushed, like they had to get the plot and all of the jokes in by a certain time, but character development, chemistry, and connection with the audience wasn't a concern. There is beauty in silence and pauses between delivered lines. The audience needs time to marinate about what they have watched, from time to time.I was also disappointed that none of the cast from ""Seinfeld"" had cameos. This is a movie where Jason Alexander would have shined and Julia Louis-Dreyfus makes everything better simply with her presence.""Unfrosted"" was underwhelming. Tons of potential with moments of laughter and times where it hits the target. It should be re-made, but this time add some frosting."," Unfrosted needs some frosting."
"2","Megalopolis","dedawson-82561","5 May 2024","5/10","This is like a movie made to include all the banter in the writers' room for a sitcom. Like, ""Hey, what if the Seinfeld character gets out of his car and he's rolling it barefoot like Fred Flintstone's car,"" one writer would say, and another writer would say, ""and he's got a big rock in the back for a brake like an anchor."" And the room chuckles and instead of just moving on, they put it in the show. The cameos of actors and comics are fun. The old brand names are cool, except no one under 60 will understand many of them. It's silly, cartoonish, and basically pointless. See it as a lark that got produced because Seinfeld is Seinfeld. Throw your critical standards to the wind and guess who's playing the Walter Cronkite character."," Cameos and callbacks but not really funny"
"3","Megalopolis","spoonerstreet","4 May 2024","","All you need to know about this movie is that the world's greatest comedian decided that writing a cow fart joke into this movie was a good idea. Every minute of this movie is just a bother excuse to put a comedian friend into the film. The best actor in the movie is the little girl (oh and Hugh Grant) and there are some real heavyweights in this one.It had some real potential, but just like every other movie released by Metflix, it had no idea what it wanted to be. Sometimes an Airplane wannabe, sometimes a weird art piece, and other times taking the absolute shortest path to a bad joke.It really had potential, but it is now just the 20th straight bad movie that Melissa McCarthy has been in."," Completely soul-less"
"4","Megalopolis","mukesh-jethwani","5 May 2024","5/10","I wanted to like it so bad. I kept on waiting for it to get funny or interesting. After half the movie, I asked myself why am I torturing myself with this movie. This movie is not even funny. There are dry jokes here and there but it's not funny. I was really excited when I saw the cast and who it was directed by but damn I was wrong. With so many good actors and actresses there is so much that could be done to make it funny. Either way, may be it gets funny after half the movie but I don't have the will or desire to watch the remaining half. Either way, there was a lot of potential and I had high hopes."," I wanted to like it"
"5","Megalopolis","RedMars2017","3 May 2024","","This feels like that Dick Turpin series on Apple TV: proof that no matter how talented the cast of comedians, if the script ain't funny, it ain't funny. It starts off like a weird but charming mix of Willy Wonka and Airplane, but then descends into a big budget car crash.I imagine Jerry Seinfeld went to Netflix and said ""I'd like to make a film about my love of cereal and I can get my mates to act in it"" and at no point during production did anyone tell him that maybe it's not working.It does have a couple of funny bits but outstays it's welcome by 90 mins. Enough here to fill a wacky sketch. But when 30 mins of jokes rely on them misnaming Pop Tarts ""Trat Pop"", you know you're in trouble. Avoid."," Awfully unfunny"
"6","Megalopolis","passenger70","3 May 2024","4/10","This a really funny film but the drawback is that the references are all so specific to the early 60's (with a few anachronisms) that a lot of younger reviewers will have their hair parted by the sheer volume of jokes going over their heads. They can however enjoy the stacked cast (loved Bill Burr as JFK) and I dare I say that it manages to redeem some actors like Amy Schumer and Melissa McCarthy who have been in the cultural doghouse for quite some time. The script is packed with all sorts of wild ideas and sometimes even gives some food for thought. What at first seemed like a silly idea for a story reminded me that that's what comedies are and the script had so much detail that I was reminded of all sorts of movies from Blake Edwards to Willy Wonka. Thanks Jerry for making an actual comedic movie - something I haven't seen in a long while."," Soda Pop Art"
"7","Megalopolis","gehete-40949","3 May 2024","","Pretty much the worst criticism you can lay on to a comedian but it is true. The movie has a satirical premise with lots of comedian cameos and a loosely reality based success story of the kelloggs staple procuct pop tarts. The story or premise are never the focal point, just elements to start sketch like scenes with over the top acting and comedic lines. The sketches however are never very funny, the few celebrity cameos kind of fall flat and the overthetopness never reaches absurdities warranting so bad that its good status. I was not expecting a bee movie type landing on your feet happenstance but i was hoping for it after the trailer made it look like there was quality comedy involved yet the movie started out weak. But no real saving grace to be found here. Just very mediocre, very flat and unfunny."," not funny"
"8","Megalopolis","Wiebkewestedt","4 May 2024","1/10","This has a lot of funny references, it's definitely entertaining. I don't know why it's rated so low. It simply does not deserve that. The acting is great, the cast outstanding, the story is fun to follow.The big actor names keep coming, and it certainly makes the movie! It's cute! I suppose, if you're looking for a realistic documentary on the birth of the pop tart, you'll probably be better off reading up on Kellogg's and Post but I don't think that's the intent of this movie. I watched this by myself and laughed out loud several times, I think that's a pretty good sign. Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it. Unless you're a super grumpy person."," What's not to like, it's very entertaining!"
"9","Megalopolis","jbrassar-1","5 May 2024","","Jerry Seinfeld should have stayed home and sit on his money instead of producing, directing and leading in this pile of frosty and unfunny, unfrozen mishmash of nonsense. How much have they paid the media to review this as good family entertainment?? If there is any moment that is reality-based in it, I've entirely missed it. As for the jokes, from every star cameo to the main ensemble delivering them, they are so forced and disconnected, as if they were all written separately without concern for the development of the story. It was embarrassing to watch many talented actors be dragged through this mess, hamming it up left and right, I'll make an exception for John Hamm who delivered without self-conscious mockery.It felt like Hugh Grant was cursing himself for being in it every time he showed up. Truly en embarrassment. Don't waste your viewing time."," Fails on every level"
"10","Megalopolis","kookookeedoo","9 May 2024","7/10","Is this the funniest movie I've ever seen? No. But it is definitely the funniest movie I've seen lately. And that's quite an accomplishment, considering I'd have no reservations about watching this with my 8 year old nephew. Of course, a lot of the humor would be over his head, but who would have thought that a movie so utterly unobjectionable could also be so funny? Kudo's to Jerry Seinfeld, because I think he's succeeded in making a live action movie with a level of comedy similar to classic cartoons. You know what I'm talking about- absurd, slapstick, yet with that bit of wry, adult humor that the kids don't get but the adults find very funny. Not to mention that this movie also probably has one of the best comedy ensemble casts of all time. Granted, it may have gotten a little too silly at a few points, but no movie is perfect. I'm really surprised to hear people hating on it so much. I went in with very low expectations based on the reviews, but I was literally laughing consistently through the whole thing. The world could use more comedy like this. Nice work Jerry!"," Do people just not like fun movies anymore?"
