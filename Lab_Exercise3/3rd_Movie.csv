"1","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","mihaistaninxs","22 May 2024","9/10","I just finished to watch the movie premiere here in my country and i was soooo satisfied!Let me start with the beginning: The little girl who plays Furiosa did an amazing job even if her dialogue was minimum! She was great! Chris Hemsworth as Dementus was funny, scary and...demented! This role of a villain was great for him and much much better than the last Thor interpretations!Anya Taylor-Joy was, from my perspective, a much better Furiosa than Charlize Theron! She did an amazing job!The CGI was there but it was top notch and the ones who complained about the use of CGI doesn't understand a movie like this needs some CGI!The vehicles, motorbikes were steampunk constructed and cool! Dementus truck was a BEAST!!! The roaring of the engine was beyond cool! It was amaaaaazing! The young Immortan Joe was decent, his boys are there(from Mad Max: Fury Road) .Some little brutality, little humor that worked like a jewel!A little minor Spoiler: i think there was a little, very little scene of Max filmed from behind..there was his car as well. The verdict: A must seen, a must seen in theater for the best feeling! The sound of motorbikes and that beast, the Dementus truck motor engine sound was so cool!!! 9/10 from me!"," It was great!"
"2","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","andrewchristianjr","22 May 2024","8/10","A badass female revenge story with a character who can only trust herself in the game of survival. This film has car chases and biker hordes and flaming death, but almost more impressive are the small moments of beauty that you won't find anywhere else.Synopsis:
Snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers, young Furiosa falls into the hands of a great biker horde led by the warlord Dementus. Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel, presided over by the Immortan Joe. As the two tyrants fight for dominance, Furiosa soon finds herself in a nonstop battle to make her way home."," WHAT A CINEMATOGRAPHY."
"3","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","dam-24421","19 May 2024","9/10","When I say breaking bad, LOTR is a 10, and I give this a 8, thats an amazing score and compliment.I thought there was no way this movie was gonna beat fury road, but wow i was surprised. I cannot tell you what it lacked, because I truly feel like this movie was so well rounded, and diligently executed. It had action, script, well playing actors, drama, cinematography and music!!This is what you come to the cinema for, how lucky are we to have watched to extremely good movie this year already ( dune 2 ). I could be talked in to watching this a second time for sure.Oh god I love good movies!"," It's not a 10, but great movie!"
"4","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","kmkevinn-64733","15 May 2024","10/10","In the desolate yet visually stunning landscape of George Miller's latest masterpiece, ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"" the audience is thrust into a maelstrom of high-octane action and profound storytelling. This prequel to the critically acclaimed ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" not only expands the lore of the titular character but also redefines the boundaries of the action genre. Anya Taylor-Joy had 30 lines of dialogue that delivers a tour-de-force performance as Furiosa, embodying the character with a fierce determination and emotional depth that captivates from the first frame. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of the villainous Dementus is both charismatic and menacing, providing a perfect foil to Furiosa's heroism. George Miller's direction after watching FURY ROAD is nothing short of masterful & beautiful creations of what road action is really like; he crafts a narrative that is both expansive and intimate, with each set piece surpassing the last in scale and spectacle. The cinematography is a character in itself, painting the Wasteland of ""WHAT A LOVELY DAY"" with a palette that is as beautiful as it is desolate.""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is a testament to the power of myth-making. It's a film that not only honors its predecessors but also stands on its own as a monumental achievement in cinema. With a perfect blend of relentless action, compelling characters, and a story that resonates with the human spirit's indomitable will, this film is the best films of this year of action. It cannot be lower at all. It delivers the goods with a gold plaque."," FURIOSA is a GOLD PLAQUE of the YEAR with HIGH ON ACTION"
"5","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","ryanjohnsoniowa","15 May 2024","10/10","I didn't think they could top Fury Road, but they did. I didn't think Taylor-Joy would pull off a young Furiosa after how well Theron played the part. But she did, stellar performance.The real surprise is Hemsworth. Best performance of his career in my opinion. Didn't think his character as the villain could be played with such depth - he was perfectly cast, and wouldn't be surprised if he gets several best supporting actor nods during award season.The quality of the acting overall was a surprise, but I expected awesome action sequences, and it didn't disappoint: the War Rig fight scene is just awesome. Miller and his team stepped it up even more from Fury Road, still giving the same look and feel of the brutal Wasteland, but with even more grittiness and realism, obviously taking advantage of advances in production since 2015.Overall it is one of those rare prequels that is better than what was already a great sequel. I can't wait to watch it again when it is out on streaming and watch Fury Road immediately after."," Best Movie in Mad Max Franchise"
"6","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","Isak777","22 May 2024","9/10","I saw Furiosa in a ScreenX thetar and this film was so good that as soon as I left the theater I couldn't decide if it's better than Dune Part Two, but it's not. A lot of things were better than Mad Max Fury Road, like for instence Anya Taylor Joy is a better Furiosa than Charlize Theron, the film itself is as good as Mad Max Fury Road, but it is better than the old films. I just really think that George Miller needs to make a sequel to Fury Road. I heard he has an idea for a Max prequel.It is too early to predict but I believe this film will go to the Oscars and might be nominated for cinematography, director, costume design, makeup and more since Mad Max Fury Road won 6.The film has such beautiful cinematography, such a great soundtrack, script, actors, action... everything was so good. I can't think of anything I didn't like about this film.Chris Hemsworth was amazing in this film playing the villain Dementus.I think you should see this film on the big screen. I'm just glad I watched it in a cinema."," The best prequel ever made"
"7","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","valmont1702","22 May 2024","10/10","High-octane fresco of the greatest mastery that is, or if a blend of punk and heavy metal had a visual language in order to tell you and show you an initiatory journey of the most explosive dramaturgy.The storytelling is a pure never ending rollercoaster of the highest intensity, with at the same time, a lot of emotional depth and philosophical layers...Anya Taylor-Joy as always kills it and takes over the frame with depth and silent strength... The evolution of Furiosa throughout the story is quite a bliss to experience and witness. From a survivor with a dream, to a chameleon with a spirit of vengeance, to a leader for the sake of reigning in order to live on and eventually make this broken dream into something real again (?)
Chris Hemsworth's character of Dementus is the perfect mirror to Furiosa's dark side while he is the very instigator of this ""Imperator"" in the making.Important to mention that, even if Anya Taylor-Joy is technically the lead role of this movie, the fact is that the majority of the lines of the movie are majestically served by a Chris Hemsworth at the top of his game ! I don't know if it's Oscar worthy, but he for sure delivered a truly great performance from beginning to end (and what a mesmerizing ending that invites you to reflection).The whole piece is -as expected- highly flattering for your very eyes, while your heart rate is very probably gonna reach some dragster type of speed !...
The settings, like in Fury Road, are dirty & decayed while hitting you with rich rusty shades of orange, red and yellow....and it's heavy on metal of course ! Metal, gasoline and...adrenaline. The richness of the content of the film expands in many ways the lore of Mad Max, adding a lot of new tasty details that upgrade this fictional world and give it all even more meaning and importance.To me, beyond the absolutely delightful photography of the movie and sheer mastery in the art of staging and framing action & characters... The big X Factor and bonus that amplifies the whole experience of the movie is the powerful humane vibrance at its core... It gives this uncommon movie an extra flavor that takes it up a notch and makes it a true masterpiece (but yeah, the extremely fine photography and crazy epic action makes it all otherworldly catchy, ngl) ; that's just like nothing else you've ever seen."," More than a movie, a burning epic ode to cinema and storytelling as a whole"
"8","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","belatony","21 May 2024","9/10","This is not Fury Road, nor should it be. The film has many of its predecessors high octane moments but fleshes out a deeper cut, revealing greater layers of its wound. I would say it's what Mad Max (1) was to the Road Warrior (Mad Max 2). Also it's one of those rare times where the trailer doesn't give away the many surprizes the film has to offer, in fact, the film isn't at all what I was expecting and what the trailers reveal, which is a good thing. If you are a fan of the wasteland world of the Mad Max saga, this adds a layer that makes you craving for more slices to be shared, I hope these stories are shared for years, please Mr Miller, let us not wait 9 more years, Maximum Fury should be the next title."," A tale to be bold"
"9","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","Ratingzzz","22 May 2024","9/10","From start to finish, Furiosa is filled with heart-pounding action sequences, breathtaking visuals, and a captivating storyline. Anya Taylor's performance as Furiosa is nothing short of incredible, showcasing her strength, determination, and vulnerability. The film's post-apocalyptic setting is brought to life with stunning cinematography and jaw-dropping practical effects.The intense chase scenes and thrilling battles will keep you on the edge of your seat. Furiosa is a modern action classic that deserves all the praise it has received. Don't miss out on this epic adventure!You should see this one the biggest screen possible!"," Furiosa is an absolute thrill ride, with jaw-dropping action, a kickass female lead, and visuals that will leave you breathless!"
"10","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","babook-1","21 May 2024","7/10","""Fury Road"" took me by surprise and blew me away, so I was really looking forward to this movie.It's a fairly good movie but it really pales compared to the previous one.If ""Fury Road"" was the movie ""Troy"", this one would be ""300"".Where ""Fury Road"" felt bigger than life, many many scenes and shots in ""Furiosa"" feel like a small sound stage with a green screen, just like in ""300"", and many CGI shots look fake, with all of physics being totally off.Showing shots of ""Fury Road"" at the end really didn't help.It's enjoyable, cast is fantastic, it feels like ""Fury Roads"" but much much cheaper."," It's... Fairly good... But..."
