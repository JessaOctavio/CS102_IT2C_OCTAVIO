"1","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","dam-24421","8 May 2024","8/10","I'm a big fan of all the planet of the apes, and they nailed this one. Usually when they start milking series like this, they come out bad, but with the amazing cinematography and great acting, it more than succeeded. Some movies just deserve to be watched on a big screen, and this is one of them. The movie had me intrigued, and interested in the storyline unlike a lot of other movies I've seen this year. I'm looking forward to what they will come up with after this, and I can assure you that I will be watching no matter what. Go grab a popcorn and enjoy the phenomenal graphics this movies has to offer! Godspeed."," A phenomenal start to another trilogy!"
"2","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","druss44121-1","10 May 2024","6/10","Really wanted to like this. The previous trilogy is excellent, and I'd even say it's one of the best genre trilogies ever made (LOTR is #1, of course). Dawn is especially a masterpiece of intelligent sci-fi adventure spectacle, a movie that is both exciting and intelligent. The entire trilogy is emotionally engaging and Caesar is an incredible lead.Unfortunately, this film doesn't have any characters as good as Caesar. In fact, it feels like a lesser retread of the same ideas and themes of the previous trilogy. There's nothing really new here. You've already seen a better version of this movie before.With that said, let me get the good out of the way first. The cinematography is excellent. The visual effects are still incredible, both as a technical and artistic achievement. The first 45 minutes of the film are really solid. There's a lot of good visual storytelling in the opening act.However, once we meet the main antagonist, things kinda fall apart. The pacing is off. Some scenes drag, while major character moments feel rushed. There's a friction between two major characters that doesn't feel earned, especially since the characters kinda come to an understanding, and then a few scenes later they are butting heads. What could and should have been an interesting dynamic feels incomplete, like entire scenes were cut out.The main antagonist could have been really cool. The idea of a cult-like warlord obsessed with human history, there's so much they could have done with that idea. But he simply doesn't have enough scenes to really make him anything more than Koba Part II. And Koba had better motivations and more complexity. None of the characters here are as well written as the previous trilogy and the last 10 minutes feel more like a TV finale than a movie.Oh, and the music score is pretty generic and forgettable. Really disappointing, because I love the music from the other movies. Caesar's theme is so good. Nothing here comes close.Anyway... Kingdom is far from terrible, but to quote another major franchise with a movie coming out May 2024: ""Mediocre!"""," Not as good as I hoped"
"3","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","bsabillon","11 May 2024","6/10","I'm bummed I didn't love this. The visuals are as good as ever, both from cinematography to cgi it just looks fantastic. Unfortunately it falls flat mostly everywhere else. A classic hero's journey through the remnants of this universe's apocalyptic landscape is a great idea, but the journey itself is just devoid of sauce. It's bland, and often just feels like we're watching scenes checking off boxes from an adventure story. Like a movie coming out of an assembly line. Character motivations are unclear, the mc's emotional arc is unclear, and overall every idea just doesn't feel fleshed out, even when they almost have a good one. How Caesar's legacy is handled in this movie is almost interesting, but again it is not fleshed out. I will say the movie starts strong, I didn't really start turning on it til I realized how bored I was about halfway through. And that's before the third act really just frustrated me. Almost feels like we're seeing the first draft of a potentially great movie. Still excited to see where the franchise goes, but this new set of movies is off to a rough start for me."," Basic hero's journey in a bland entry to a great franchise."
"4","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","thomasgouldsbrough","10 May 2024","6/10","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes isn't a bad film, nowhere near as impressive as the other films in the franchise. Whereas Rise and Dawn had really interesting explorations of the human condition, and presenting human nature as being both inherently selfish and inherently altruistic in an engaging manner, Kingdom fails to present human characters of much substance. The female lead lacks depth, she's just inherently selfish throughout the entire film, even as going so far as to use Noa to get the satellite link.The opening to the film, after the egg scene which was very strong, was a little weak. Caeser strives incrediblely hard to find his oasis, and yet it gets destroyed within the first 15 minutes of the film, in about 5 minutes? It effectively retconned the last film, Caeser's sacrifice was for nothing.The ending is quite good. By introducing the concept of the human survivors, it makes for an interesting way to introduce a new trilogy. Kingdom isn't necessarily a bad film, but nowhere near as impressive as the complexity of Rise and Dawn, or even the original Planet of the Apes and Beneath the planet of the apes."," Doesn't hold a candle to the other planet of the apes films"
"5","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","deason","9 May 2024","8/10","This movie is just about a worthy successor to the original set of movies from the 20th century.Like them, it uses state of the art special effects to wittily investigate contemporary questions of ethics, humanity, status and prejudice while distracting the popcorn crowd with an engrossing adventure of exploration, captivity and escape in a make-believe world that, in what is a strong science fiction tradition, is recognisably a few ""what if?""'s away from our own.Unlike the original five movies, where each sequel was originally unplanned, this is clearly a new ""chapter one"", taking the time to introduce some elements that will feature in the upcoming sequels.Over and over it evokes the sense of wonder of the original handful, with plenty of specific visual, musical and thematic evocations. There are reognisable influences from the 1970s TV show and even some of the Apes comic book stories of that era. But, it is also unmistakably a post-Lord of the Rings epic, the influence showing up in how various action and travel sequences have been shot.While there is not nearly so much sly humour as the originals, the socio-historic themes are more nuanced, closer to the surface and harder to miss. Questions of defining civilisation in terms of laws are answered in a way that will ultimately resonate with modern audiences; a layered and varied spectrum of responses to enslavement is shown; and as expected, anti-monarchist revolutions will always play well in the USA.Non-Americans may roll their eyes a little at the very earnest equating of eagles with capital-L Liberty (one can't imagine Charlton Heston's sardonic and cynical George Taylor from the 1968 movie being very impressed), but on the plus side, Peter Macon's wonderful Raka just about matches the delightful charm of Kim Hunter's Zira and Roddy McDowell's Cornelius from the originals. Owen Teague also does a good job as Noa.The various fight scenes are competent without being overly thrilling (the most exciting action is a cornfield chase vaguely inspired by the original 1968 film), but the deeper probing into the various sub-texts and a fine selection of minor characters keeps the interest levels up. One could pick nits about some of the physics shown in the last twenty minutes, but it's hardly the first Hollywood film to sacrifice strict logic for spectacle and it surely won't be the last.Overall, this does a good job of working on several levels and should appeal to a good range of audiences."," Deeper and nuanced exploration of original themes"
"6","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","brianmcd1-355-272263","12 May 2024","6/10","Are there any directors left that have watched a Spielberg movie so they can see how to pace an action adventure movie? Very few movies are actually so well written, acted and directed as to warrant a 2:30+ hr run time. This was not one of them. But with some proper editing, you could make a tight 2:10 movie that keeps things moving along.The story wasnt bad. The characters werent bad. The acting was good enough. They just took a very long time to get to anything. Then the action picks up for a bit, things get good, it gets exciting and you get another long dull 15-20 min segment. A good editor would bring those segments down to 5-10 min and keep the movie rolling along."," Can we get an editor for this movie?"
"7","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","dinomadaan","9 May 2024","8/10","Greetings from OppositeofColumbus. Like many, I thought the trilogy wrapped up years ago. So when I heard of the next movie, my first reaction was - why? While I liked the trilogy, I didn't think they had been quite the blockbusters to spawn another trilogy, and they had a sombre tone. Nevertheless intrigued, I went for the early screening not having even watched a trailer or read anything about it.First off, watch it on whichever premium format you can. The CGI is really well done from apes emoting to the dramatic terrains.I liked that the hero was a little diffident at first but grew with the story. Sure we've seen it a thousand times, but it was still an identifiable journey.The ideology splits were shown well, the action sequences were effective and the shades of characters kept me interested. Sure it left a few questions hanging, but I guess those are for the sequel(s).Pacing did feel slow at times but I like that personally better than nonstop effects and explosions. Mae was the more intriguing character, with Noa's arc (see what I did there) being a more predictable one. If you let yourself go on the journey, I think you'll enjoy it. No huge surprises in the story though - you'll know if you're gonna like it or not pretty much in the first act. Have fun!"," Sure, a little slow, but nicely done!!"
"8","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","AfricanBro","10 May 2024","7/10","I was waiting just to hear Proximus scream 'WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY!' from all the times I heard the trailer playing at the theatre. I really liked how the franchise once again showcases the humanity of the apes, like the touching funeral scene. It had breathtaking scenery throughout, especially the transformation of metropolitan cities into forests. I found it interesting how they introduced pets, a bird is an ape's best friend, essentially. I liked that we exploring their customs in the first act of the movie.While the film's length and the extensive world-building sometimes made it feel a bit slow, every scene served a purpose in the end, especially considering this's setting the stage for a new era in the Planet of the Apes movies. We get to see how the environment, the apes and the humans have evolved. I liked how the movie paid homage to Caesar without directly continuing his story; his legacy felt respectfully acknowledged. He had a good run and his story was complete.The premise of the movie, particularly the portrayal of the antagonists, reminded me of religious wars, where the apes resemble Christian crusaders using a historic figure's image to justify war and violence, a theme with deep implications. The movie addresses that but not in a way that will make you leave the theatre pondering. How teachings can be misconstrued.This installment's message felt more overt compared to the trilogy, almost as if the apes were portrayed as essentially human. The trilogy was always telling a human story through apes, it was always obvious but now the fourth installment is quite on the nose.Good time is spent with the characters, so when moments of sadness or goodbyes arise, we feel it too. It's slow paced but I was heavily invested. The scene where she calls out to Noah was amazing. Hearing an 'echo' speaking, was almost as shocking when Caesar screamed ""go!"" for the first time. Also was she essentially looking for an English textbook? Lol.While Noah is the lead character, there were instances where Mae took the forefront, causing some confusion about the movie's primary focus. She didn't feel explored or interesting enough but I loved Freya Allan's performance.It's a drama. It's not what I was expecting, I thought it'd me more action packed, but it's still good. It was different to my expectations the way ""War for the Planet of the apes"" also wasn't a full blown war as well. I also think this is the first movie since the trilogy started where earth was now actually a planet of apes. Humans clearly have been dominated.Following up on Caesar was always gonna be difficult, I think he was a beloved character and we got to see his whole journey. The new lead character Noah is alright, however, I didn't find myself super captivated by him. We got to see Caesar's full character arc, birth to death; while Noah is already a little older, coming-of-age age. His story is still interesting though.The conflict of ideas between Noah and Mae could have been more intense. There were times when I thought ""ouu this is about to be a big fight/argument"" and it's just meh. It wasn't as thought provoking as I would've liked. I liked Proximus Caesar though, I thought he made quite the enticing antagonist. Second most interesting character after Raka*.The ending hints at the possibility of another trilogy, laying a solid foundation for future installments. Overall, I liked it more than ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" but not as much as the sequels. ""Dawn of the planet of the apes"" is still my favorite. It's not as epic as I thought it'd be; I think it's more enjoyable if you're already into the franchise. It doesn't do anything terribly, I just didn't walk out of the theatre thinking ""wow!"" People were applauding a lot throughout the movie actually. There was a guy who sat close to me and blacked out before the movie started, snoring the entire time. Thought about not waking him up after the movie finished because everyone literally just walked by him. This dude bought imax tickets, large bucket of popcorn, large soda and some more snacks, all that just to sleep before the movie started. Anyway, I still enjoyed the whole thing, and very much looking forward to whatever's next.Also just found out it's directed by they who did maze runner movies and they actually both have such similar aura to them."," Sequel is probably gonna be titled ""empire of the planet of the apes"""
"9","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","Isak777","8 May 2024","8/10","A great follow up to the last trilogy. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes was my most anticipated film of 2024 and honestly, it's my favorite film of 2024. Not the worst from the Apes franchise but I'll need to rewatch it to decide which one is the best one.I don't really think you need to see the prequels to see this one. Beautiful cinematography and amazing work on VFX. The acting is great too!The film is meant to be seen on a big screen so I would recommend Imax.I hope this film won't flop because it would be a shame.I'm genuinely happy I got to see this one in a cinema because I love the prequels and this is a film that really is made for cinema.I can't wait for the next chapter of the newest Planet Of The Apes trilogy."," A great start to a new trilogy"
"10","Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes","moviemik-3","12 May 2024","6/10","I don't know if it's just me because in the past 52 hours I have watched all of the Planet of the Apes movies (excluding Tim Burton's horrible 2001 version) but it seemed to me that this movie was just OK.Taking place ""many, many generations"" after Caesar dies, an ape named Noa and his two friends are going through a rite of passage that has to deal with collecting hawks' eggs when an intruder comes into camp breaking the egg he has collected and was holding for the ceremony the next day. Therefore, he needs to go and collect another egg before said ceremony. While he is out, he runs into a band of apes hurting other apes and they track him back to his village, which they decimate and bring Noa's clan into servitude. Noa escapes and seeks out his family and comes across an orangutan named Raka, and they both encounter a human woman who, it turns out, can talk. They are captured and brought to the palace of Proximus Caesar, an evil gorilla who desires to have all apes under his kingdom.While there are many, many nods to the original 1968 film (including musical cues) and the movie had very stunning visual effects, the story itself was kind of lethargic when it wasn't in set piece mode.The acting - with a couple of exceptions - was just okay and this is an indication that future movies need a protagonist that meets the stature of Andy Serkis and Roddy McDowell. Owen Teague as Noa, is barely adequate and the same can be said for Freya Allen as Mae, the talking human. She obviously has ulterior motives, but her performance doesn't. The only three actors in the film that are worth mentioning are Peter Macon as Raka, the orangutan, whose motion capture seems to show his jovial good nature and charm, William H. Macy (yeah! That guy!!!) as a human who educates Proximus Caesar on human history and literature and who radiates the word ""collaborator"" and finally the great character actor Kevin Durand, as big bad Proximus himself. Durand, as he always does, radiates menace.There's no reason that this story could not have been accomplished in less than 145 minutes and it just seems that nowadays the name of the game is to make movies longer for the sake of making movies longer. This movie really dragged, not because of any poor story choices (because the story itself was decent), but because of poor choices in the editing room.I see where this movie trilogy is going and it's fine but is the next motion picture going to be two hours and 45 minutes long and the final movie in this trilogy going to be three hours long? These are Planet of the Apes movies - we're not the defining Pi. The notion that somehow longer is better is absolutely ridiculous.This is the worst of the reboot films since 2011Yeah, watch it because it's not horrible but it could give you a headache (although I may have a headache because I forgot my eyeglasses when I went to the movie theater but, thankfully, I sat in the fourth row and my eyesight isn't that messed up that I couldn't see)If you're into monkeys, WATCH IT - Otherwise, Skip it3/5."," Shorter would have made a big difference"
"11","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","koltonbrett","15 April 2024","8/10","As a fan of both Henry Cavill and Guy Ritchie, I was thrilled to find an early access showing of this movie at a nearby theater.Ungentlemanly Warfare looked to be a good time, and indeed it is! It's a neat story and they made the telling of it fun. Thankfully it isn't goofy. It's not nonstop jokes, but it has a good sense of humor and I heard a good bit of chuckling in the theater throughout the movie, much of it coming from myself.You can tell Cavill had fun with this role. He shows off some range as his character is very different from the brooding muscle man that many people associate him with. It was delightful watching him do comedy. I haven't seen much of Alan Ritchson's work, but it was easy to see why he has such a growing fanbase. He's the muscle in this movie and proves to be a great action star. The whole cast is great and they give us a lot of fun characters.Action-comedies seem to be Guy Ritchie's specialty. He maintains a good balance of action and comedy and works so well with large casts as he lets every character feel like they matter to the story."," Fun Movie, fun cast!"
"12","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","ghettoplex","23 April 2024","6/10","Let me start with the positives.Like most Guy Ritchie films, the ensemble has great chemistry. Henry Cavill doesn't disappoint, he keeps the pace going and interactions between everyone fun to watch. Alan Ritchson does great as a force of nature, dude is built like a tank. Babs Olusanmokun is slick, he has a very smooth demeanor to his performance. Lastly, Eiza Gonzalez is absolutely beautiful, however her performance was hit or miss for me. But she hit more than she missed.Now, the negatives.The movie doesn't feel like it was even made by Guy Ritchie. Instead it feels like someone else were trying to make a ""Guy Ritchie"" film.I would watch it again, but it is not in my recommendation list if I were to convince someone to get into Guy Ritchie films."," I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either"
"13","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","jblippman-150-589854","28 April 2024","6/10","I guess when you set out to make a film based on a true story-- not inspired by, but actually based it-- you're constrained by events.Unfortunately, there wasn't much tension or ever a sense of our heroes having met their match.The dialogue was occasionally clever, and the acting was ..fine. Not a lot was asked of this talented cast. Also, as often happens with ensembles, we really only get to know our characters on the most superficial level. (Ensembles need franchises to tease out individuals' personal stories). Hard to be invested in their survival.And finally, what a waste of Henry Cavill. Cavill has a great face for this sort of role. Smirks, frowns and grins were swallowed up in a curiously overgrown mustache and beard. Why hire That Face and then hide it completely? Similarly, he spends the entire film, bundled up in multiple shabby layers of clothing. We're they trying to hide his physique so he wouldn't look too much like his costar Ritchson? Not a problem as Ritchson has at least 3 inches and 25lbs of muscle on Cavill any day of the week.They could have hired any one of a dozen other actors for the role if they didn't plan to let us SEE Cavill. And paid a lot less for them.I came away annoyed by the promise of Cavill unfulfilled and by a storyline that wouldn't have made for an interesting episode of The A Team.But Alan Ritchson was great. He clearly had way more fun with this character than he gets to have with Reacher."," Some charm but no heart."
"14","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","mark-67214-52993","27 April 2024","7/10","Guy Ritchie's ""Ungentlemanly Warfare"" is based, kinda, on the true exploits of Britain's Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II. Unsurprisingly, given Ritchie's involvement, liberties have been taken with the story.The SOE existed to operate behind enemy lines, committing sabotage and various other acts considered ungentlemanly by the upper crust officers who ran the conventional army. In 1942, England was starving and its army could not be resupplied because German U-boats owned the seas. With the blessing of Winston Churchill, the commander of the SOE sent a team to destroy the Duchessa d'Aosta, a supply ship that supplied all the carbon dioxide filters for the U-boats. These filters permitted these submarines to remain submerged for prolonged periods. By disabling the supply ship, the U-boat fleet would be effectively sidelined. The mission was labelled Operation Postmaster. It took place in January, 1942. This story centers on the real characters - Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), Anders Larssen (Alan Ritchson) and Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer) - who were sent to complete this mission. In this film, some totally fictitious characters and other amalgamations of real-life participants also tagged along.""Ungentlemanly Warfare"" contains all the satisfying flourishes of a film by Guy Ritchie (""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""Sherlock Holmes,"" ""The Gentlemen""). This film is cool and stylish. It's filled with swaggering characters spouting cheeky dialogue. There are flashbacks to keep the moviegoer off-balance. There are first-rate set pieces/action scenes. Oh, and there's violence - lots and lots of violence, most of it gratuitous. Did I mention the violence? The entire package is delivered with a manic gleefulness that's contagious.While the story is ""based on true events,"" reality is just a jumping off point. This film suggests that a major role of the operation was to persuade an officially neutral US to enter the war and begin helping Britain. Pearl Harbor occurred the month before, so the US was already fully engaged. The film also suggests that by disabling the supply ship, the SOE's mission could change the course of the war. While the events depicted in ""Ungentlemanly Warfare"" were not unimportant, a bigger factor was the development of RDX, an explosive powerful enough to sink the U-boats in the open sea.The film offers an interesting side note. One of the staffers for the SOE depicted in the film is a young officer named Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox). Yep, that Ian Fleming. His boss was known as M. In his James Bond novels, Fleming incorporates the character of M. Fleming has noted several times that the character of James Bond was based on Gus March-Phillips.To summarize, the cast here is charming and appealing, in no small part because they appear to be reveling in their madcap roles. Some of the location shots (much of the movie was filmed in Antalya, Turkey) make the film as worthwhile as a NatGeo documentary. The ""true story"" is a muddled mess. And there's the violence, lots and lots of violence. (Historical note: no one was actually killed during Operation Postmaster, although one Nazi soldier fainted at the sight of the intruders.) Guy Ritchie's energy and enthusiasm, which permeate this piece, will win over a lot of the folks in the seats."," Great Guy Ritchie Insanity"
"15","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","markdv-19","20 April 2024","7/10","This was a very fun movie with satisfying action scenes. The action scenes can be over the top at times but it does not feel like a movie you need to take super seriously. I enjoyed every scene with the core five actors.The movie does drag a bit in the middle of the movie. This is based on a true story so I get why it's important to see all the parts of the operation. However, there is a lot of dialogue and slow pacing in the middle. It focuses a lot on what I would consider the B plot.By the end of the movie it ramps back up and you get a satisfying climax with all the parts coming together. Overall very fun laid back movie, especially if you are interested in history and WW2."," Fun movie with a little drag in the middle"
"16","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","Ryan331","16 April 2024","6/10","The movie is fun for the most part, but not the strongest Ritchie film. The trailer is a great representation of the film - the cheekiness, costumes, violence, and Henry Cavill's twirly mustache. If you liked the trailer, you'll probably enjoy the film.I do think the movie could've been a lot more but was bogged down by the ""true story"" aspect. There are a few scenes that felt very Tarantino-esque in its hyper violence or intensity, but likely couldn't be taken further because of the limitations of a true story. While not mad at the casting, they could've skipped on giving Alan Ritchson the crappy danish accent. And when Eiza Gonzalez's character's ethnicity is introduced, you'll probably raise an eyebrow considering she's a Mexican actress."," WW2's Oceans 11"
"17","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","rwhnd","16 April 2024","9/10","The movie is a beef cake sandwich crammed with testosterone and rippling biceps-- Henry Cavill and Alan Ritchson have wonderfully comedic and sincere chemistry as they chew their way through Nazis.Guy Ritchie's sensibilities are on full display-- sharp transitions, character introductions, banter worthy of Tarantino, and charm. Spiritually this film feels like a violent successor to The Man from UNCLE despite it being set decades prior. The plot is straight forward and allows for a talented cast to stretch their legs.I certainly hope this movie leads to larger action roles for Ritchson who has been stellar to date."," Violent, Exciting, Fun"
"18","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","darkreignn","15 April 2024","7/10","Cinemark has brought back its Secret Movie Series, and having never been to such an event before, I found myself intrigued and, for the low price of $5, I simply couldn't resist buying a ticket. I was one of six people in the theatre - clearly, a secret movie experience is a hard sell. However, I was excited at the prospect of watching something without knowing exactly what it would be. And after the trailers concluded, the lights dimmed and the film began to roll - to my delight, the secret movie was ""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.""As a Guy Ritchie fan, after having seen the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it - although, admittedly, I didn't think the trailer was especially striking. However, I like Ritchie, and I love Cavill, so I was pleasantly surprised at the reveal of this film being the secret movie. And you know what? This is actually a pretty fun flick.Yes, there is nothing too innovative at play here - this is standard Ritchie fare, except more nuanced and less extreme in its directing and editing choices than, say, Ritchie's King Arthur film. ""Ministry"" plays out more like a typical action adventure movie with flares of Ritchie's signature style coming out here and there; and this more subdued approach actually works to the movie's advantage to highlight some of the more dramatic and intense moments. But if you're going to see this film, you're most likely going to see it due to the action that the trailer promised you. And how is the action? In a word: Great.My only complaint about the violence in this film - not to sound too bloodthirsty - is that it is surprisingly bloodless for an R-rated movie. I was really expecting something akin to Quentin Tarantino, with huge spurts of blood and gory deaths, but Ritchie, once again, takes a more subdued approach, choosing not to showcase a lot of blood or grisly images. That said, the action in this movie is still FANtastic, playing out an intensity that is simply missing from most modern action movies. There are plenty of shootouts - both with guns and with arrows; there are knife fights and axe battles; there are hand to hand combat sequences; basically, all of the WW2 action you can imagine is in this movie, and it's filmed wonderfully, without shaky camera or quick cuts. Sure, I would've preferred a bit more blood when Nazi's were punched or shot or sliced, but I can't knock Ritchie for choosing not to include that for the sole reason that the action is filmed so freaking well. It's nice to watch an action movie that has two things: 1) a lot of action and 2) clearly filmed action. Luckily, ""Ministry"" has both of those things, and because of that, will be sure to satisfy even the most jaded action junkie.In Ritchie films, both the plot and the actors are always standouts, and it's no different here in ""Ministry."" Cavill and his band of ungentlemanly warriors are all super entertaining to watch, their chemistry leading to many laugh out loud moments. Additionally, the plot - as IMDB puts it, ""a small group of highly skilled soldiers strik(ing) against German forces behind enemy lines during World War II,"" offers a lot more meat to chew on than you might expect. There are a lot of things happening concurrently, which leads to storylines converging in a pretty satisfying way. There are also a few unexpected moments that force the plot to go in directions I didn't expect, but certainly enjoyed watching. The plot isn't anything phenomenal, but it kept me engaged and was a great vehicle for its characters and action.""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare"" is a good time at the theatre. This doesn't necessarily offer something that you haven't seen before, but in a genre as tired as WW2 action is, ""Ministry"" shakes things up just enough in terms of its colourful characters and explosive action that you can't help but have fun watching this. And if you're a fan of Guy Ritchie? Then going to see this is really a no brainer."," Colourful Characters and Well-Filmed Action Injects New Life into the WW2 Genre"
"19","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","malmevik77","15 April 2024","9/10","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly WarfareThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a true story set in World War II. The story was largely unknown to the public until 2016 when documents from that era were declassified.The dramatized narrative does have its silly moments, as shown in the previews, but the story is nothing but. Had these brave men and women not completed the mission, there is a chance Hitler would have won the war.If you wish to see arrogant Nazis get shot, blown up, tortured, stabbed, or otherwise maimed, then definitely go see this movie. It was most satisfying to see as many of them hurt as possible. Even knowing that the Germans lost the war, I was on the edge of my seat during the covert action, but also laughing out loud while they perform said action.There are so many movies made about World War II that I was very pleasantly surprised to see one that I knew nothing about. I know this was intentional as the operation was classified. So many acts of bravery and heroism still continue to not see the light of day, and I cheered (along with the rest of the audience) at the conclusion.It's very much an R rated film, but this is one that everyone should see.

"20","The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare","artistwriter-54705","16 April 2024","6/10","Saw this at an early access showing. It was not what I had hoped, but more or less what I expected. If you like movies based on Historical events, that seem to also show the connection between new film franchises, and old, this is a pretty good film for that.You have Henry Cavill walking through the entire film, with zero sense of urgency. You have the poor man's Gal Gadot, who does nothing but act as eye candy and a distraction to both the on screen talent, and the audience. You have Alan Ritchson who more or less steals the entire film as the lunatic killing machine. Honestly everyone does a decent job but frankly you could have cast anyone in this movie and it would have turned out the same.I like some things I have seen by Guy Ritchie, but this movie is a little less interesting because everything is so bland and safe. Visually, it's okay. It's not great. There were some good moments in the movie and some funny things that happen, but you can see where the moment lingers and the tension is not there at all. That's the thing. I did not feel one bit of tension for anyone at any time in this movie.That's the real sad part about this film, as you don't care about anyone before, during or after things get rolling. There's no air of menace to any of the bad guys, there's no chemistry between any of the characters. You see some glimpses but it's one scripted scene after another and there really is no acting.Why should I expect more? It's not like anyone is producing any really compelling films that make history interesting."," With an All Star Unutilized Cast"
"21","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","mihaistaninxs","22 May 2024","9/10","I just finished to watch the movie premiere here in my country and i was soooo satisfied!Let me start with the beginning: The little girl who plays Furiosa did an amazing job even if her dialogue was minimum! She was great! Chris Hemsworth as Dementus was funny, scary and...demented! This role of a villain was great for him and much much better than the last Thor interpretations!Anya Taylor-Joy was, from my perspective, a much better Furiosa than Charlize Theron! She did an amazing job!The CGI was there but it was top notch and the ones who complained about the use of CGI doesn't understand a movie like this needs some CGI!The vehicles, motorbikes were steampunk constructed and cool! Dementus truck was a BEAST!!! The roaring of the engine was beyond cool! It was amaaaaazing! The young Immortan Joe was decent, his boys are there(from Mad Max: Fury Road) .Some little brutality, little humor that worked like a jewel!A little minor Spoiler: i think there was a little, very little scene of Max filmed from behind..there was his car as well. The verdict: A must seen, a must seen in theater for the best feeling! The sound of motorbikes and that beast, the Dementus truck motor engine sound was so cool!!! 9/10 from me!"," It was great!"

"24","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","kmkevinn-64733","15 May 2024","10/10","In the desolate yet visually stunning landscape of George Miller's latest masterpiece, ""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"" the audience is thrust into a maelstrom of high-octane action and profound storytelling. This prequel to the critically acclaimed ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" not only expands the lore of the titular character but also redefines the boundaries of the action genre. Anya Taylor-Joy had 30 lines of dialogue that delivers a tour-de-force performance as Furiosa, embodying the character with a fierce determination and emotional depth that captivates from the first frame. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of the villainous Dementus is both charismatic and menacing, providing a perfect foil to Furiosa's heroism. George Miller's direction after watching FURY ROAD is nothing short of masterful & beautiful creations of what road action is really like; he crafts a narrative that is both expansive and intimate, with each set piece surpassing the last in scale and spectacle. The cinematography is a character in itself, painting the Wasteland of ""WHAT A LOVELY DAY"" with a palette that is as beautiful as it is desolate.""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is a testament to the power of myth-making. It's a film that not only honors its predecessors but also stands on its own as a monumental achievement in cinema. With a perfect blend of relentless action, compelling characters, and a story that resonates with the human spirit's indomitable will, this film is the best films of this year of action. It cannot be lower at all. It delivers the goods with a gold plaque."," FURIOSA is a GOLD PLAQUE of the YEAR with HIGH ON ACTION"
"25","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","ryanjohnsoniowa","15 May 2024","10/10","I didn't think they could top Fury Road, but they did. I didn't think Taylor-Joy would pull off a young Furiosa after how well Theron played the part. But she did, stellar performance.The real surprise is Hemsworth. Best performance of his career in my opinion. Didn't think his character as the villain could be played with such depth - he was perfectly cast, and wouldn't be surprised if he gets several best supporting actor nods during award season.The quality of the acting overall was a surprise, but I expected awesome action sequences, and it didn't disappoint: the War Rig fight scene is just awesome. Miller and his team stepped it up even more from Fury Road, still giving the same look and feel of the brutal Wasteland, but with even more grittiness and realism, obviously taking advantage of advances in production since 2015.Overall it is one of those rare prequels that is better than what was already a great sequel. I can't wait to watch it again when it is out on streaming and watch Fury Road immediately after."," Best Movie in Mad Max Franchise"
"26","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","Isak777","22 May 2024","9/10","I saw Furiosa in a ScreenX thetar and this film was so good that as soon as I left the theater I couldn't decide if it's better than Dune Part Two, but it's not. A lot of things were better than Mad Max Fury Road, like for instence Anya Taylor Joy is a better Furiosa than Charlize Theron, the film itself is as good as Mad Max Fury Road, but it is better than the old films. I just really think that George Miller needs to make a sequel to Fury Road. I heard he has an idea for a Max prequel.It is too early to predict but I believe this film will go to the Oscars and might be nominated for cinematography, director, costume design, makeup and more since Mad Max Fury Road won 6.The film has such beautiful cinematography, such a great soundtrack, script, actors, action... everything was so good. I can't think of anything I didn't like about this film.Chris Hemsworth was amazing in this film playing the villain Dementus.I think you should see this film on the big screen. I'm just glad I watched it in a cinema."," The best prequel ever made"
"27","Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","valmont1702","22 May 2024","10/10","High-octane fresco of the greatest mastery that is, or if a blend of punk and heavy metal had a visual language in order to tell you and show you an initiatory journey of the most explosive dramaturgy.The storytelling is a pure never ending rollercoaster of the highest intensity, with at the same time, a lot of emotional depth and philosophical layers...Anya Taylor-Joy as always kills it and takes over the frame with depth and silent strength... The evolution of Furiosa throughout the story is quite a bliss to experience and witness. From a survivor with a dream, to a chameleon with a spirit of vengeance, to a leader for the sake of reigning in order to live on and eventually make this broken dream into something real again (?)
Chris Hemsworth's character of Dementus is the perfect mirror to Furiosa's dark side while he is the very instigator of this ""Imperator"" in the making.Important to mention that, even if Anya Taylor-Joy is technically the lead role of this movie, the fact is that the majority of the lines of the movie are majestically served by a Chris Hemsworth at the top of his game ! I don't know if it's Oscar worthy, but he for sure delivered a truly great performance from beginning to end (and what a mesmerizing ending that invites you to reflection).The whole piece is -as expected- highly flattering for your very eyes, while your heart rate is very probably gonna reach some dragster type of speed !...
The settings, like in Fury Road, are dirty & decayed while hitting you with rich rusty shades of orange, red and yellow....and it's heavy on metal of course ! Metal, gasoline and...adrenaline. The richness of the content of the film expands in many ways the lore of Mad Max, adding a lot of new tasty details that upgrade this fictional world and give it all even more meaning and importance.To me, beyond the absolutely delightful photography of the movie and sheer mastery in the art of staging and framing action & characters... The big X Factor and bonus that amplifies the whole experience of the movie is the powerful humane vibrance at its core... It gives this uncommon movie an extra flavor that takes it up a notch and makes it a true masterpiece (but yeah, the extremely fine photography and crazy epic action makes it all otherworldly catchy, ngl) ; that's just like nothing else you've ever seen."," More than a movie, a burning epic ode to cinema and storytelling as a whole"

The film has many of its predecessors high octane moments but fleshes out a deeper cut, revealing greater layers of its wound. I would say it's what Mad Max (1) was to the Road Warrior (Mad Max 2). Also it's one of those rare times where the trailer doesn't give away the many surprizes the film has to offer, in fact, the film isn't at all what I was expecting and what the trailers reveal, which is a good thing. If you are a fan of the wasteland world of the Mad Max saga, this adds a layer that makes you craving for more slices to be shared, I hope these stories are shared for years, please Mr Miller, let us not wait 9 more years, Maximum Fury should be the next title."," A tale to be bold"

I'm really surprised to hear people hating on it so much. I went in with very low expectations based on the reviews, but I was literally laughing consistently through the whole thing. The world could use more comedy like this. Nice work Jerry!"," Do people just not like fun movies anymore?"
"51","The Idea of You","TananaKo","27 April 2024","","I saw this last night at the Atlanta Film Festival alongside a friend who is also in her 40s. We went into it calling it ""the Harry Styles fanfiction movie"" and knowing it was going to be a bit of a fantastical and sexy romp, but we both agreed at the end that we were surprised at how emotional we got watching it. I guess I shouldn't actually be surprised at this knowing that Jennifer Westfeldt was one of the writers, since I'm a huge fan of how she portrays women and relationships. (Kissing Jessica Stein is one of my major cultural touchstone movies.) I'm also a big Michael Showalter fan, but had never really associated him with telling this kind of story before. He gave a Director Q&A after, and I really appreciated hearing him talk about the process of making this, especially with regards to not making Hayes or the idea of being in a boy band a ""joke"" or something to poke fun at.The best part of this movie is the fact that it shows something we rarely see on screen: the idea of a woman in her 40s being found intriguing, sexy, and desirable, and the object of pursuit by a younger, attractive man. The way that it achieves this is nothing new to movies - love at first sight, Solene being the only woman he can think about, and that she stirred something in him that no one else can. This is a common mechanism in female fanastical romances (see also: Fifty Shades of Grey) because, well, it's one of the biggest fantasies we all have, especially for heterosexual women. (Let's hope that it doesn't spawn an epidemic of middle-aged women ""accidentally"" breaking into band trailers at music festivals.) But it does, at its core, speak to a fantasy that anyone who wants to be loved has: that we will be seen for who we are, not for our familial or life situation, the wrinkles on our face, or the birthdate on our driver's license.The other unique thing that the movie portrays is the idea of men being emotionally vulnerable. The way that you see Hayes falling for Solene and expressing his feelings about her is not something you see very often with male leads. Again, this may be a bit of a heterosexual female fantasy, but I think it comes at a time when society is beginning to be more accepting and understanding of the need for men to be able to express their emotions. If you want to know why so many women love The Notebook (another fantastical romance), think about how you see Ryan Gosling's character show just how emotionally attached he is to Rachel McAdams's character. You don't see this in that many movies, but when you do, there's a very good chance that women love it.The film also makes good points about the hypocrisy of society with how Hayes and Solene's relationship is treated, how no one bats an eyelash when male celebrities date women 10, 20, even 50 years younger than they are (ahem, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino), but the idea of a woman dating a younger man is scandalous. This is a point made by Annie Mumolo, who I always love to see on screen, but who is regrettably underutilized here as the best friend character. There is definitely a feminist undercurrent to the movie, including some really cute lines made by Solene's daughter, but it's doesn't hit you over the head with it.Although there are some areas I would've liked to have been handled better, such as the scene where there's tension with the other band members, overall it's a sweet and emotional movie that gives us something I think all women would agree that we want: recognition that we are more than just our age."," Surprisingly emotional and sexy"

However, Hathaway truly owns 40 in this 2024 romcom as she plays Solene, a successful Silver Lake art gallery owner still smarting from a divorce three years prior. While taking her teenaged daughter to Coachella, she meets Hayes Campbell, the 24-year-old lead singer of globally popular boy band August Moon. Sparks fly immediately, and homemade sandwiches lead to an extended rendezvous on a world tour. While Nicholas Galitzine fulfills the limited contours of his role as a smitten pop star, it is really Hathaway that delivers the goods giving an accomplished performance that finally adds maturity to her natural effervescence. Directed by Michael Showalter (whose last film was 2022's underrated ""Spoiler Alert""), the movie definitely swerves with predictable plot turns, but at least thanks to the observant script by Showalter and the wondrous Jennifer Westfeldt, it moves with a certain aplomb that makes it watchable.

"53","The Idea of You","hannahb-56182","4 May 2024","","Sex and concerts. That was predominantly what this movie consisted of...I didn't mind how the movie began with them accidentally meeting at Coachella in his trailer. I actually thought that, that was a very cute moment. But, the way the movie proceeded from there was extremely rushed. Hayes goes to see Solem at her gallery, calls her hot, and then they start hooking up.And, there's nothing wrong with two people just wanting to have some fun and hook up. However, what I found hard was that we were only shown these sexual moments rather than moments where their relationship builds...emotionally. Thus, making the time they finally say they love each other completely inconsequential. Because as it was, there was nothing that led up to that, that would make that moment feel significant.Truthfully, I was hoping this movie was going to end with them not getting back together, because I think that not only would have been unexpected, but also realistic. In my opinion, these two characters didn't belong together, and in reality, they probably wouldn't have worked. So, I think they could have given us a nice bittersweet ending similarly to the movie, The Breakup. I just feel that it would have been a fresh and unique move to make.Him waiting five years for basically an f-buddy didn't seem genuine.Overall this movie was okay, I did like that they showed the consequences of dating someone in the industry as opposed to glorifying it, and how it affected everyone, not just Solem. But the long, drawn out concert scenes were cringey and unnecessary, and took away time they could have used to incorporate meaningful instances between the love interests."," Where Was the Falling in Love?"

One day as her ex-husband is about to take the daughter and friends to Coachella he pulls out due to business in Houston, Solène fills in.

"56","The Idea of You","rialovesthenotebook","4 May 2024","6/10","Anne and Nicholas both had great acting. Worth the watch if you liked movies like Fifty Shades, and rom coms. However, i do think it was rushed, and not that much plot besides a boy in a boyband,
and a girl who sells art. The romance scenes are good, but it's very fast paced. I wouldn't expect much better than most romance flicks, but the music played is good. I thought it was kinda weird for her to be 40 and him to be 20, and that be the basis of it, i'm not sure what they were trying to do with that as Anne and Nicholas look about the same age and you don't really think of that the whole movie.

"57","The Idea of You","olcare","2 May 2024","","Due to the high ratings and the high Metacritic score, I was curious and decided to give it a chance. Yes, the movie is definitely not bad, but it's a bit hastily resolved for a 74 Metacritic score, and the real-life drama isn't fully explored due to this speed.First of all, unexpectedly, I really liked the acting and the vibe of the film. I found the allure, sexuality,hot and sensuality of the film to be on point, and I believe this was achieved thanks to Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine. I found the film successful in this regard.Overall, the screenplay is not very original but not bad either, and I'll address its biggest issue at the end.I liked the color palette of the film and the fun, fast-paced scenes during the European tour. It all fit together nicely, and the film didn't fall apart, even though it may not have had a great screenplay. Additionally, I noticed that the film's premise was sometimes unfairly criticized, like lynching in certain places. At this age, we should stop easily judging things that everyone should decide for themselves, like race or choices. We don't have to love or approve of everything, but we should respect others. If you didn't like it very much ,engage with your peers in your own life.Now, onto the biggest letdown of the film for me. The film rushes through the part where it should really throw the audience against the wall when the good story takes a nosedive. This likely has to do with its duration, but it greatly reduces the film's score in my eyes. Because in real life, people don't just get through such cruelty by crying or waiting; life is much harsher and crueler. Moreover, when we fast forward five years, the rush continues and events are easily resolved, which greatly diminished the drama part of the film in my eyes due to these two things.Yes, I know this is a rom-com, but a more dramatic portrayal of such a radical and harsh issue would have made the film more memorable. It's perfectly suitable for an evening movie.Note: In terms of similarity, I watched May December this year, which portrayed the subject matter much more seriously and clearly, but it was also a messy screenplay.Note2: I guess there isn't anything a mother wouldn't do for her daughter or son."," The real life hits a bit different."

I think the only decent thing I have to say about it is that the quality of the shots is actually quite allright.The actors who were supposed to be mother and daughter and who were supposedly father and son felt nothing like it. I don't have anything against the actors, they just did not match at all. They felt like the more believable relation towards eachother would have been as friends, but just with an age gap. And how weird was the story; all the events happened within seconds and the bride said her mother was a piece of work but they could not be more lovely people. There was no real-life drama and no trauma (good for them).But finally; how weird and how horrible would it be if your mother and father-in-law got engaged. I could not see the fact that my mother got a relationship separate from that my mother is dating my husbands dad. That's just too much."," Just too awkward"

At the US Open, they meet Tashi (the amazing Zendaya who really can do anything) and are both captivated. It is quickly noticed by Tashi that Art and Patrick seem to be more than best friends.Challengers takes us back and forth through time, bouncing rapidly just like a tennis ball crossing the court. When the two men both pursue Tashi, it is very clear that Tashi is the tennis ball during the intense relationship between the two men. She mentions early on that tennis is more than just a game, and boy does this film work those themes hard.The previews left out the fact that LGBTQ+ themes are explored, but with subtlety. The sexual tension between Art and Patrick is so thick, I was left wondering where their relationship was headed. Both men wanted Tashi, but only Art succeeded in marrying her.The tennis metaphor, and the literal matches, fill the movie with excitement and tension that never gets old or tired. Be prepared to pay close attention because of the rapid fire changes between the three leads. I know Zendaya gets top billing, but I still say that she's the tennis ball; being served between Patrick and Art.Also, I have to point out that my favorite soundtrack artists lately, Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch (yes Nine Inch Nails) did the music. They are popping up a lot lately in films, and they never disappoint.This movie was more of an erotic thriller than I thought it would be, because the previews barely touched on the real film. This is a movie worth talking about with friends, so please feel free to engage me. There is a lot left open for interpretation, and a couple of plot holes that weren't filled. One big example is Patrick shows signs of bruising near a vein in his arm. That's an obvious sign of drug abuse, but it's never mentioned other than it being noticed.Highly recommended film. I'm biased because I love tennis, but I'm a sucker when a literal theme is used as metaphor as well. Go see it.

The conflict of the movie is very much centered on the way they both approach the game of tennis and how Zendaya's character is pretty much the one in control.

The director is either very incapable of his job or hasn't either. They hired Brad Gilbert to consult and help. Ok, but he helps with the wrong aspects. In the end of the day a general viewer would not care if the serve technique is correct, or if the movement and speed is accurate.

There's nothing even remotely similar to this movie.

Layers and layers until, yes, a true CLIMAX. I don't write reviews, but this movie just grabbed me and excited me about film again. I'm home, sitting on my bed, and my heart is still pounding strong.

"98","Challengers","ztpbrmhw","29 April 2024","8/10","First of all, this movie has an 80s-style vibe that we have seen many times before that could have well been told in a conventional 90-100 minute movie. This movie truly was not ""important"" enough to tell it over 131 minutes. Add to that there were pointless extended shots that you were begging to end. At about 100 minutes in, audience members were looking at their cellphones either to check the time or they were getting restless.Second, there were excessive timeline jumps. It is often a useful story-telling device, but here it was excessive and distracting - so much so that when they did another timeline jump there was a consensus ""groan."" Making matters worse, is that there were time jumps as long as 13 years. However, Zendaya --- bless her heart --- as much as they tried to ""age"" her and ""de-age"" her through hair and make-up, she never looked, to me, older than about 17 years old regardless of the time era.Third, while I credit Zendaya for tackling such a meaty role, and as much as I otherwise adore her, she just simply seemed to young to be so ""weathered"" and ""jaded"" and ""cynical"" and ""ruthless"" and ""calculating"" as she was. Further, I really don't remember her smiling once throughout the movie. And as I have read in other reviews, she seemed to have a resting ""scowl"" throughout the movie - ironically very much similar to the scowl she had throughout both Dune 1 and 2.And lastly, by the end of the movie, none of the three characters were likeable, and, perhaps, oddly, sadly, Zendaya was, to me, the least likeable. And from a film character study point of view, the viewer is never given a reason or backstory for this.With all these distractions in mind, I was so eager for the movie to end that I lost all investment whatsoever in who won or lost in the story's big moment."," Challengers was a challenge to sit through for 131 minutes"
"99","Challengers","olcare","8 May 2024","","I really enjoy high-quality sports movies, but this film uses tennis as a metaphor for a love triangle involving three abnormal individuals in a very accurate way.Let me just say why this film is good. Firstly, it's technically very good. I'll detail the scene I'll say is the best, but overall, the use of cameras, where they stand, and the masterpiece climax in the final scene, make the direction top-notch.The casting fits the script perfectly. Sometimes, it's the actors who determine the tension of a film, and in this film, our trio of leads creates a fantastic tension, very successfully.Thirdly, the use of sports as a tool. In normal sports films, the main focus is on the sport and the plane it creates, but Challengers goes beyond that and metaphorizes tennis very successfully. And tennis could truly be the most individual among individual sports, so it's a very apt choice. The metaphor of the tennis ball being Tashi, especially, enchanted me. The back and forth between Art and Pat, and finally Art winning because of the Grandslam, is not an easy metaphor.Fourthly, and the part I loved, the climax scene is amazing. Taking such a risk in shooting in such a different technique and jolting the audience in the theater with that scene is really well done. Putting the camera in place of the ball, drawing a bomb on the camera, shooting from different angles, all accompanied by a simple music that tells the tempo very well, is really the right move.Fifthly, the film's sexiness is very well placed. The love scenes are not exaggerated and really well placed. Maybe the red-lighted scene at the end is a bit swagger, but all the characters look very sexy. Congratulations to Zendaya, Mike Faist, and John O'Conner, good job.The point I didn't like is that the simple concept of family wasn't filled out enough, in my opinion. When Art and Tashi's child is mentioned, there should have been a flashback to that period and the importance of that in their lives should have been explained. Yes, the film is super-paced and great, but I feel it lacks something, and with a 5-6 minute scene added, the film could have been a 10/10 for me. Also, the focus on Pat's wound. Since we focused on it, we could have had 1 or 2 scenes of Pat's suffering as well.And finally, I want to address people's comments. I think the ratings are exactly what the film deserves, the positives are very dominant, but there are minimal shortcomings, so the ratings are just right. Some people have said (especially in my country), ""oh, we were very uncomfortable, it's exaggerated,"" etc. Dude, the whole point of the film is to try to explain a sick situation; all three characters have big personal problems; one worships people, the other worships sports (and of course, meaningless ambition and success), and the other behaves loosely and cowardly. Sorry, but it's silly to accept this situation as normal and make comments; excuse my bluntness, but watch the movie and try to understand it.The film is very enjoyable and flows excessively, not a second boring, watch it in the cinema.Additionally, some of the argument scenes in the film and the overall structure also resemble a tennis match, I forgot to explain (metaphor) that in my review, but I think this is also a major factor in the film's success. (For example, the argument scene between Tashi and Patrick in their rooms fits perfectly. This fight just like a tennis match.)"," The use of metaphor is spot on."

The score really elevated the whole movie, in my opinion. I liked how the storyline had a good combination of present day and past tense. Made the climax that much more exciting.I'm not normally a big sports movie person but this one, while definitely a movie about tennis, is more a movie about the characters and their love, passion and what is it that drives us at our core to be competitive.Acting was very good. Zendaya was great.Would see again."," Worth seeing in theaters"
"105","Challengers","PedroPires90","22 April 2024","","What I love about Guadagnino is that he never tries to replicate others or do something that can be very forgettable. Even if it's not always easy to see the similarities between Call Me By Your Name, Suspiria, Bones & All and Challengers, one thing is certain: they all have a very distinctive approach and are unique cinematic products.The score of this film is incredible, it's like a whole trip and it evens contributes to make us anxious like we are watching a tense thriller. It is a very sexy film even if sometimes it feels a bit trapped to the Hollywood safe sense of disruption.The trio is amazing and I was the entire time mesmerised by Zendaya, who lives the more complex and nuanced of the three characters. The tennis scenes are very cool and I love many of the artistic choices, especially the creative editing process, not only in terms of the structure but some fantastic montages."," Unique"

"107","Challengers","jsnyda","23 April 2024","","This movie absolutely FLOORED me. The direction, the script, the music, the ""acting"" (I put quotations there because it felt like real life, the acting was perfect). The way the camera moves was CONSTANTLY fresh. One stop-motion-esque scene in particular --- but PLEASE, just go experience it for yourself. It's better than anything this year and will be bound to become an all time classic. There's nothing even remotely similar to this movie. The all-time most impressive thing about this movie is how at the start of the movie there is little attachment to the characters and then it reveals more and more layers until literally you are at the edge of your seat all the way up to the finish line. Layers and layers until, yes, a true CLIMAX. I don't write reviews, but this movie just grabbed me and excited me about film again. I'm home, sitting on my bed, and my heart is still pounding strong. This makes me want to create something. This is ART. 10/10."," Back and forth, in a trance... 10/10"
"108","Challengers","ztpbrmhw","29 April 2024","6/10","First of all, this movie has an 80s-style vibe that we have seen many times before that could have well been told in a conventional 90-100 minute movie. This movie truly was not ""important"" enough to tell it over 131 minutes. Add to that there were pointless extended shots that you were begging to end. At about 100 minutes in, audience members were looking at their cellphones either to check the time or they were getting restless.Second, there were excessive timeline jumps. It is often a useful story-telling device, but here it was excessive and distracting - so much so that when they did another timeline jump there was a consensus ""groan."" Making matters worse, is that there were time jumps as long as 13 years. However, Zendaya --- bless her heart --- as much as they tried to ""age"" her and ""de-age"" her through hair and make-up, she never looked, to me, older than about 17 years old regardless of the time era.Third, while I credit Zendaya for tackling such a meaty role, and as much as I otherwise adore her, she just simply seemed to young to be so ""weathered"" and ""jaded"" and ""cynical"" and ""ruthless"" and ""calculating"" as she was. Further, I really don't remember her smiling once throughout the movie. And as I have read in other reviews, she seemed to have a resting ""scowl"" throughout the movie - ironically very much similar to the scowl she had throughout both Dune 1 and 2.And lastly, by the end of the movie, none of the three characters were likeable, and, perhaps, oddly, sadly, Zendaya was, to me, the least likeable. And from a film character study point of view, the viewer is never given a reason or backstory for this.With all these distractions in mind, I was so eager for the movie to end that I lost all investment whatsoever in who won or lost in the story's big moment."," Challengers was a challenge to sit through for 131 minutes"
"109","Challengers","olcare","8 May 2024","","I really enjoy high-quality sports movies, but this film uses tennis as a metaphor for a love triangle involving three abnormal individuals in a very accurate way.Let me just say why this film is good. Firstly, it's technically very good. I'll detail the scene I'll say is the best, but overall, the use of cameras, where they stand, and the masterpiece climax in the final scene, make the direction top-notch.The casting fits the script perfectly. Sometimes, it's the actors who determine the tension of a film, and in this film, our trio of leads creates a fantastic tension, very successfully.Thirdly, the use of sports as a tool. In normal sports films, the main focus is on the sport and the plane it creates, but Challengers goes beyond that and metaphorizes tennis very successfully. And tennis could truly be the most individual among individual sports, so it's a very apt choice. The metaphor of the tennis ball being Tashi, especially, enchanted me. The back and forth between Art and Pat, and finally Art winning because of the Grandslam, is not an easy metaphor.Fourthly, and the part I loved, the climax scene is amazing. Taking such a risk in shooting in such a different technique and jolting the audience in the theater with that scene is really well done. Putting the camera in place of the ball, drawing a bomb on the camera, shooting from different angles, all accompanied by a simple music that tells the tempo very well, is really the right move.Fifthly, the film's sexiness is very well placed. The love scenes are not exaggerated and really well placed. Maybe the red-lighted scene at the end is a bit swagger, but all the characters look very sexy. Congratulations to Zendaya, Mike Faist, and John O'Conner, good job.The point I didn't like is that the simple concept of family wasn't filled out enough, in my opinion. When Art and Tashi's child is mentioned, there should have been a flashback to that period and the importance of that in their lives should have been explained. Yes, the film is super-paced and great, but I feel it lacks something, and with a 5-6 minute scene added, the film could have been a 10/10 for me. Also, the focus on Pat's wound. Since we focused on it, we could have had 1 or 2 scenes of Pat's suffering as well.And finally, I want to address people's comments. I think the ratings are exactly what the film deserves, the positives are very dominant, but there are minimal shortcomings, so the ratings are just right. Some people have said (especially in my country), ""oh, we were very uncomfortable, it's exaggerated,"" etc. Dude, the whole point of the film is to try to explain a sick situation; all three characters have big personal problems; one worships people, the other worships sports (and of course, meaningless ambition and success), and the other behaves loosely and cowardly. Sorry, but it's silly to accept this situation as normal and make comments; excuse my bluntness, but watch the movie and try to understand it.The film is very enjoyable and flows excessively, not a second boring, watch it in the cinema.Additionally, some of the argument scenes in the film and the overall structure also resemble a tennis match, I forgot to explain (metaphor) that in my review, but I think this is also a major factor in the film's success. (For example, the argument scene between Tashi and Patrick in their rooms fits perfectly. This fight just like a tennis match.)"," The use of metaphor is spot on."
"110","Challengers","cfballalife","5 May 2024","9/10","The only reason I went to see this movie was to see if Zendaya could hang with the big dogs. To see if she can carry a film all by herself. She has the talent, she has the looks. She has it all. I think this movie is a good start to launch her career as a bonfide movie star. That being said, the movie itself was okay. Just okay. Not great, not bad but okay. I thought Zendaya was good. Her performance was something I expected, which I guess is a good thing. Didn't blow me out of the water but overall good. The actor who played Patrick, in my opinion did a great job. However everything else about this movie just fell short for me. Too much style and not enough substance."," Too much style, not enough substance"
"111","The Fall Guy","masonsaul","3 May 2024","","Whatever problems The Fall Guy has really aren't an issue when the final product is this much fun. It's a loving tribute to the never ending selflessness of stunt people wrapped inside of an endearing romantic comedy and meta action film.

His comedic timing continues to be faultless, proving he can make any joke land.Emily Blunt thankfully also gets a lot to do. Any scene she shares with Gosling is effortlessly charming and she has her own brand of bona-fide movie star charisma. Winston Duke is a great movie referencing support to Gosling, Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a hilarious McConaughey impression and Hannah Waddingham's cartoonishly over the top producer really works.David Leitch's direction plays squarely to his strengths and after the disappointment of The Gray Man, it's extra satisfying to see Gosling be given some actually good fight scenes.

Perhaps never before have a film been focused so much on the unseen heroes behind many great films - the stunt doubles delivering shockingly realistic portrayals of the action. And in that respect The Fall Guys succeeds- it's action sequences are delivered flawlessly, and are breathtaking to behold.

Praise should also be given to the films two charismatic leads. Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling share palpable chemistry and are simply endearing to behold. They are affable, amiable, and funny. But ultimately my problem with this film is that it is unevenly paced, lacks enough humour, and has too thin a plot to retain an audiences full attention. The films firstly takes too long to get its plot started, resulting in a laborious introduction, a sped through mid section, and a bombastic but slightly rushed ending. The film also does not exert its full potential of comedy. The film does not make use of action comedy(as best exemplified by the Jackie Chan films) or a particularly witty script. Indeed the script is rather dull, sometimes trite, and altogether not very sharp or exciting. Then there is the films plot. I can comment not much other than that it is the recyclable convoluted B-grade plots which are common in movies. It is predictable, ludicrous, and quite inexcusable. So at the end of the day, The Fall Guys is a good comedy that acts as a wonderful tribute to the art of stunt work, bolstered by strong, effervescent performances between its two leads.

"131","IF","pvqpmwgnj","13 May 2024","","This was a visually stunning and whimsical movie. It had a star studded cast with Ryan Reynolds, John Krazinski and Steve Carell. In fact it could have done without a star playing the dad I thought, as this detracted from the emotional opening scene.

"151","Abigail","FeastMode","19 April 2024","","Abigail is awesome. It's creepy, fun, thrilling and surprisingly funny. I enjoyed the tone and the music. The fantastic cast plays distinct and memorable characters, with standouts being Melissa Barrera and Dan Stevens. The horror elements are (in Billy Butcher's voice) diabolical. The movie overall is so far from traditional horror flicks and I wish more would go this route instead of the generic movies Hollywood pumps out.The most important thing I can tell you is to try going into this movie knowing as little as possible. Definitely don't watch the trailer. It gives away so much and shows all the best parts. Even for someone like me who doesn't watch trailers, every poster and advertisement blatantly shows something that you don't find out until halfway through.I'll rant about this more in the spoilers section, but whoever is in charge of marketing has no shame. They will hurt the movie for thousands of viewers in hopes of selling more tickets. They are a scourge on the industry.Even if you have seen the trailers, Abigail is still a HIGHLY entertaining movie that I recommend to everyone.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 4/18/2024)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSYou should only read this section if you have seen the trailer or the movie. There is CLEAR intent by the filmmakers to hide the fact that Abigail is a vampire and is the threat they're worried about. They spend the first half wondering who her father is and who he sent to kill them. They start questioning if it could possibly be one of them.All of this mystery is ruined by the trailers and posters. I already knew she's some kind of monster. I spent much of the first half just waiting to get to the part where she starts killing. It was still enjoyable, but I would have been enthralled with the mystery, wondering and guessing what was happening and who the bad guy was. I would have enjoyed it even more.The scene (shown in the trailer) where she reveals she's a vampire, would have, to the full extent of the expression, blown my mind. It would have been one of the most memorable moments of any movie I've seen. The advertising company stole that moment from me and so many others. All so they could make some extra money.But I bet it would have been more profitable if they left it as a surprise. Not only would there be less people annoyed as they wait for the movie to ""get going"" since they already know what's coming. But word of mouth due to that massive reveal would have been huge.They could have advertised this as a mystery, showing them being hunted and arguing over who it could be. It would have been highly intriguing without giving much away. But no, they cater to the casuals to sell a few extra tickets, while ruining it for the loyal horror fans who were going to see it regardless.I wish there was some accountability for whoever is making these trailers. If it was up to me they would all be fired.If like me, you were underwhelmed by M3gan and thought it was far too tame and mild, this is the movie for you. This is what a movie about a young girl killer should be."," Don't watch the trailers!!! (spoilers after a warning)"

The movie is nothing you haven't seen before but even with that in mind it still manages to surprise you and be unpredictable at times with different twists and turns in the story.Overall it was a solid experience and I would definitely recommend it if you're looking to grab a cold one, kick back and get some popcorn."," Does exactly what it advertises itself as"
"153","Abigail","HerbieStretch","19 April 2024","","There is nothing in this film that you haven't seen in a number of other films but it manages, thankfully, to deliver.It doesn't for my money have as much humour as Ready or Not but does have enough character back story for the audience to know who to support and who to scorn and to emotionally commit to ( as much as you can in a horror flick).You know what is going to happen once the basic premise is exposed and it's fun finding out how and when, and watching the whole thing play out.At the centre of it all is Abigail, played expertly and delightfully by Alisha Weir who exploits this platform to showcase her undoubted talent. She is ably supported by the cast to realise this competent effort and make viewing it time well spent.I believe the film is best watched without prior exposure to the trailer, hard as that is these days, and have also not revealed any content here in that spirit.

The gang think they're coming into millions, but Abigail has a shocking surprise waiting for them.One of the horror highlights of 2024 so far, it's done well at The Box Office, and it's easy to understand why, it's definitely a crowd pleaser.A seemingly straightforward thriller very rapidly turns into a genre crossing horror movie. Abigail is a real mix of styles, it's goofy, it's funny, it's well paced, and of course there are plenty of jump scares.Very nicely made, well shot, with some good music, which surprisingly doesn't become too intrusive.You really can't fault any of the performances, credit very much to that young Alisha Weir, excellent as the title character.

After releasing two ""Scream"" sequels in as many years, they're back again with an original tale, similar to (and practically as good as) their previous hit ""Ready or Not"". ""Abigail"" isn't a masterpiece of cinema, nor is it the most innovative or best vampire movie in history, but it's massively entertaining to watch; - especially together with an outrageous crowd of horror fanatics (like I did at the Brussels International Film Festival).""Abigail"" starts off with a clichéd premise. A group of criminals that don't know each other, and each with their own area of expertise, are brought together for a special assignment. They must kidnap the ballet-dancing daughter of a wealthy person and babysit her for 24 hours until daddy pays the ransom. The kidnapping went easy, and the babysitting is supposedly the easiest part because - honestly - what could a 12-year-old girl in a cute tutu do against six heavily armed and professional criminals, right?After the derivative but mandatory first half hour (criminals showing off, traumatic background stories, pinky swears, ...) ""Abigail"" turns into a fast-paced and gore-soaked horror crowd pleaser with funny one-liners and superior make-up effects. The vampires don't look like traditional counts in cloaks, but more like demons with filthy teeth and blood red eyes. There are good performances from familiar faces (Kevin Durand, Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton) and particularly the young Alisha Weir is impressive as the titular monster in her uncanny ballet dress. Good splatter fun, nothing more but certainly nothing less."," Don't come closer, tiny dancer!"
"157","Abigail","PerryAtTheMovies","20 April 2024","","7.2/10 (Recommend)Watching the trailer I did not have high expectations for this film. I thought it would be corny and laughable, but it turned out to be more solid than had been hoped for. It's also slightly different than what I imagined as I thought it was a possessed child over mythological child.There's a good cast with a good range of personalities. They've got good chemistry that allows them to work off each other and add some humour to the film. The characters aren't just random Joe-blows that scream to no end either. They actually work at sorting out the problem in front of them. Alisha Weir (Abigail) is particular good in her role as she flips between sweet and innocent to otherworldly.The cinematography is good. It could be better, but it captures the build-up moments well enough to get heart racing. While nothing is overly terrifying there are moments that may or may not catch you off guard. There's a good amount of violence and blood to make feel like a movie where people die.As the movie finishes up it does get a little weird. The whole time you've got this cat and mouse game where things do happen, but they're drawn out so it feels boring. There's a moment when the action culminates and then the movie ends with both satisfaction and disappointment.In the end I still enjoyed the film. There's good action and decent comedy. I was able to switch off my mind and let whatever happen, happen. It allowed to have fun and get my heart racing a few times. This is a movie worth checking out in theatres. You could rewatch this movie again, but time would have to pass to enjoy it to its fullest again.That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!"," Keep your promises...."
"158","Abigail","trcrock","7 April 2024","7/10","The premise is simple, yet enticing. A group of criminals kidnap a little girl who's the daughter of a powerful underworld figure. Left with this girl as they prepare to collect the ransom from her father, they eventually find out that this little girl has quite the bite to her, and they must band together if they hope to survive the night together.Team Radio Silence have already established themselves as one of the most promising horror collectives in recent memory. Their work in the V/H/S franchise, Ready Or Not, and the latest two SCREAM movies have proven that they are a capable and reliable directorial team. So with this latest film, the question remained: would they keep their winning streak going with this one?Fortunately, this film is a blast and a half. This team have delivered what I'd argue is their best film since Ready Or Not. The action takes a second as the movie develops its central characters and gives us reasons to know them beyond their Rat Pack-inspired names. When the blood starts flowing, though, this movie takes off and flies with absolute gusto! The comedy lands SO many times here, and the actual action/gore sequences deliver in SPADES!The all-star cast excels with this. Melissa Barrera, reuniting with Team Radio Silence after the SCREAM films, shines as the central protagonist. We feel for her and why she does what she does, especially when we learn of her past. Dan Stevens is a foul-mouthed scene-stealer in this, and Kathryn Newton has a number of her own moments here. Giancarlo Esposito and the late Angus Cloud do just as well in smaller roles. The absolute standout, though, is Alisha Weir as the titular vampire. She knocks it out of the park in every scene she's in, and really makes the whole experience worth it.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this movie. Check it out with a group of friends when you can, as this movie is best viewed with a crowd. This review comes from the world premiere at the Overlook Film Festival in New Orleans."," ABIGAIL Absolutely Annihilates!"
"159","Abigail","harishnj","20 April 2024","","Okay, be prepared for gore in ""Abigail."" It's not for the faint of heart, but somehow that didn't stop me from being totally into this movie. It's one of those films where you're kind of horrified but also weirdly fascinated.The atmosphere is fantastic. They definitely nailed the whole creepy, isolated mansion thing, which just added to the tension. It constantly had me on edge, always wondering what was going to jump out next.The acting wasn't groundbreaking, but it was good enough to keep me invested. And honestly, the real star of this movie is the little girl who plays Abigail. She's got this unsettling mix of innocence and pure creepiness that works so well for the character.If you're a fan of horror movies that are a little out there, and you don't mind some serious blood and guts, you might just be surprised by how much fun ""Abigail"" is."," Abigail: A Bloody Fun Vampire Flick"
"160","Abigail","XpringlefaceX","24 April 2024","7/10","This could have had a great twist if it didn't tell you in the trailer that Abigail is the bloodthirsty vampire killing everyone. Instead the first bit of the movie is trying to make you guess who is the ""undercover"" one, who is in the house, but it's just Abigail the entire time.....like the trailer said. Okay? Waste of a fruitless plot point.The ""everybody makes horrible decisions!"" cliche.Let's split up while we're being picked off!Let's continue to split up.Let's split up until there's only 2 of us left. Clearly this is working for us.Lambert is a last ditch plot twist. ""Hey, I know I could have just said this from beginning and done this in a way that would have been over in a seconds, and I ALSO know I'm the one in the control and I could just open a window at any point in time killing Abigail, but I thought it would be best to wait until almost all of you are dead, then ask the person I lured in here for help. At night. I want to just fight her 2v1, though we could've just killed her during one of the times she was drugged into sleep, or opened the window when it was daytime, but this is much more dramatic for the sake of the movie!!""""I'm glasses guy, and I suddenly for unknown reasons hate joey now that I'm a vampire, I failed to kill Abigail, she told me where I went wrong, then I failed again! LOL! So I can make Joey a puppet! That I also fail at.

The last fight scene was so agonizingly bad and long, I was actually getting kind of annoyed in the theatre. The drama of the violence loses all meaning when regular people just won't die from literally anything.Stabbed? Ah well.Impaled? Pull that sucker out and keep going! You'll barely even bleed. We save the buckets of blood for stupid scenes, like getting turned into a vampire over the course of 20 seconds for the projectile vomiting.Broken bones? Doesn't happen in hollywood lala land.I'm begging someone out there to make a good horror movie."," Pretty Freaking bad"
"161","Abigail","FeastMode","19 April 2024","","Abigail is awesome. It's creepy, fun, thrilling and surprisingly funny. I enjoyed the tone and the music. The fantastic cast plays distinct and memorable characters, with standouts being Melissa Barrera and Dan Stevens. The horror elements are (in Billy Butcher's voice) diabolical. The movie overall is so far from traditional horror flicks and I wish more would go this route instead of the generic movies Hollywood pumps out.The most important thing I can tell you is to try going into this movie knowing as little as possible. Definitely don't watch the trailer. It gives away so much and shows all the best parts. Even for someone like me who doesn't watch trailers, every poster and advertisement blatantly shows something that you don't find out until halfway through.I'll rant about this more in the spoilers section, but whoever is in charge of marketing has no shame. They will hurt the movie for thousands of viewers in hopes of selling more tickets. They are a scourge on the industry.Even if you have seen the trailers, Abigail is still a HIGHLY entertaining movie that I recommend to everyone.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 4/18/2024)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSYou should only read this section if you have seen the trailer or the movie. There is CLEAR intent by the filmmakers to hide the fact that Abigail is a vampire and is the threat they're worried about. They spend the first half wondering who her father is and who he sent to kill them. They start questioning if it could possibly be one of them.All of this mystery is ruined by the trailers and posters. I already knew she's some kind of monster. I spent much of the first half just waiting to get to the part where she starts killing. It was still enjoyable, but I would have been enthralled with the mystery, wondering and guessing what was happening and who the bad guy was. I would have enjoyed it even more.The scene (shown in the trailer) where she reveals she's a vampire, would have, to the full extent of the expression, blown my mind. It would have been one of the most memorable moments of any movie I've seen. The advertising company stole that moment from me and so many others. All so they could make some extra money.But I bet it would have been more profitable if they left it as a surprise. Not only would there be less people annoyed as they wait for the movie to ""get going"" since they already know what's coming. But word of mouth due to that massive reveal would have been huge.They could have advertised this as a mystery, showing them being hunted and arguing over who it could be. It would have been highly intriguing without giving much away. But no, they cater to the casuals to sell a few extra tickets, while ruining it for the loyal horror fans who were going to see it regardless.I wish there was some accountability for whoever is making these trailers. If it was up to me they would all be fired.If like me, you were underwhelmed by M3gan and thought it was far too tame and mild, this is the movie for you. This is what a movie about a young girl killer should be."," Don't watch the trailers!!! (spoilers after a warning)"
"162","Abigail","cyrax-92742","9 May 2024","6/10","This is an entertaining horror movie with comedic elements sprinkled throughout it and everyone in the cast does a pretty good job with the parts they're given but Dan Stevens kills it, he steals the show in every scene he's in, killer lines and he's so damn funny you can't help but laugh. The movie is nothing you haven't seen before but even with that in mind it still manages to surprise you and be unpredictable at times with different twists and turns in the story.Overall it was a solid experience and I would definitely recommend it if you're looking to grab a cold one, kick back and get some popcorn."," Does exactly what it advertises itself as"
"163","Abigail","HerbieStretch","19 April 2024","","There is nothing in this film that you haven't seen in a number of other films but it manages, thankfully, to deliver.It doesn't for my money have as much humour as Ready or Not but does have enough character back story for the audience to know who to support and who to scorn and to emotionally commit to ( as much as you can in a horror flick).You know what is going to happen once the basic premise is exposed and it's fun finding out how and when, and watching the whole thing play out.At the centre of it all is Abigail, played expertly and delightfully by Alisha Weir who exploits this platform to showcase her undoubted talent. She is ably supported by the cast to realise this competent effort and make viewing it time well spent.I believe the film is best watched without prior exposure to the trailer, hard as that is these days, and have also not revealed any content here in that spirit. Enjoy the film."," Alisha"
"164","Abigail","Sleepin_Dragon","8 May 2024","7/10","A mixed group of criminals kidnap Abigail, a young ballerina, and daughter of a powerful business mogul. The gang think they're coming into millions, but Abigail has a shocking surprise waiting for them.One of the horror highlights of 2024 so far, it's done well at The Box Office, and it's easy to understand why, it's definitely a crowd pleaser.A seemingly straightforward thriller very rapidly turns into a genre crossing horror movie. Abigail is a real mix of styles, it's goofy, it's funny, it's well paced, and of course there are plenty of jump scares.Very nicely made, well shot, with some good music, which surprisingly doesn't become too intrusive.You really can't fault any of the performances, credit very much to that young Alisha Weir, excellent as the title character. Melissa Barrera and Dan Stevens are both good, but Weir steals the show.A cheeky And then there were none reference too.7/10."," An enjoyable horror, with some nice comedy elements."
"165","Abigail","gsdpjmcdgw","25 April 2024","","This is fun - almost in the style of Hammer. It's gory, but not scary. A clichéd plot and characters, but directed and acted with enthusiasm, and a good nod to classic vampire films. All the references were there, we were just missing Vincent Price and Christopher Lee and an over-coloured palette.There was a tongue in cheek patina right across the film. I'm not sure why it was rated 18 in the UK - unless to protect people with an aversion to tomato sauce. The gore was done with explosive fun - a real splat fest.This was surprisingly entertaining, done with gusto. Absolutely worth 90 minutes."," A lot of fun - worth seeing."
"166","Abigail","Coventry","13 April 2024","8/10","The Radio Silence collective, and directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett in particular, don't take a lot of time off. After releasing two ""Scream"" sequels in as many years, they're back again with an original tale, similar to (and practically as good as) their previous hit ""Ready or Not"". ""Abigail"" isn't a masterpiece of cinema, nor is it the most innovative or best vampire movie in history, but it's massively entertaining to watch; - especially together with an outrageous crowd of horror fanatics (like I did at the Brussels International Film Festival).""Abigail"" starts off with a clichéd premise. A group of criminals that don't know each other, and each with their own area of expertise, are brought together for a special assignment. They must kidnap the ballet-dancing daughter of a wealthy person and babysit her for 24 hours until daddy pays the ransom. The kidnapping went easy, and the babysitting is supposedly the easiest part because - honestly - what could a 12-year-old girl in a cute tutu do against six heavily armed and professional criminals, right?After the derivative but mandatory first half hour (criminals showing off, traumatic background stories, pinky swears, ...) ""Abigail"" turns into a fast-paced and gore-soaked horror crowd pleaser with funny one-liners and superior make-up effects. The vampires don't look like traditional counts in cloaks, but more like demons with filthy teeth and blood red eyes. There are good performances from familiar faces (Kevin Durand, Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton) and particularly the young Alisha Weir is impressive as the titular monster in her uncanny ballet dress. Good splatter fun, nothing more but certainly nothing less."," Don't come closer, tiny dancer!"
"167","Abigail","PerryAtTheMovies","20 April 2024","","7.2/10 (Recommend)Watching the trailer I did not have high expectations for this film. I thought it would be corny and laughable, but it turned out to be more solid than had been hoped for. It's also slightly different than what I imagined as I thought it was a possessed child over mythological child.There's a good cast with a good range of personalities. They've got good chemistry that allows them to work off each other and add some humour to the film. The characters aren't just random Joe-blows that scream to no end either. They actually work at sorting out the problem in front of them. Alisha Weir (Abigail) is particular good in her role as she flips between sweet and innocent to otherworldly.The cinematography is good. It could be better, but it captures the build-up moments well enough to get heart racing. While nothing is overly terrifying there are moments that may or may not catch you off guard. There's a good amount of violence and blood to make feel like a movie where people die.As the movie finishes up it does get a little weird. The whole time you've got this cat and mouse game where things do happen, but they're drawn out so it feels boring. There's a moment when the action culminates and then the movie ends with both satisfaction and disappointment.In the end I still enjoyed the film. There's good action and decent comedy. I was able to switch off my mind and let whatever happen, happen. It allowed to have fun and get my heart racing a few times. This is a movie worth checking out in theatres. You could rewatch this movie again, but time would have to pass to enjoy it to its fullest again.That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!"," Keep your promises...."
"168","Abigail","trcrock","7 April 2024","7/10","The premise is simple, yet enticing. A group of criminals kidnap a little girl who's the daughter of a powerful underworld figure. Left with this girl as they prepare to collect the ransom from her father, they eventually find out that this little girl has quite the bite to her, and they must band together if they hope to survive the night together.Team Radio Silence have already established themselves as one of the most promising horror collectives in recent memory. Their work in the V/H/S franchise, Ready Or Not, and the latest two SCREAM movies have proven that they are a capable and reliable directorial team. So with this latest film, the question remained: would they keep their winning streak going with this one?Fortunately, this film is a blast and a half. This team have delivered what I'd argue is their best film since Ready Or Not. The action takes a second as the movie develops its central characters and gives us reasons to know them beyond their Rat Pack-inspired names. When the blood starts flowing, though, this movie takes off and flies with absolute gusto! The comedy lands SO many times here, and the actual action/gore sequences deliver in SPADES!The all-star cast excels with this. Melissa Barrera, reuniting with Team Radio Silence after the SCREAM films, shines as the central protagonist. We feel for her and why she does what she does, especially when we learn of her past.
