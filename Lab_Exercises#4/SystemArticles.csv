Hari, Anatoly Zlotnik, Shriram Srinivasan, Kaarthik Sundar, Mary Ewers","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","We examine the modeling, simulation, and optimization of district heating systems, which are widely used for thermal transport using steam or hot water as a carrier. We propose a generalizable framework to specify network models and scenario parameters, and develop an optimization method for evaluating system states including pressures, fluid flow rates, and temperatures throughout the network. The network modeling includes pipes, thermal plants, pumps, and passive or controllable loads as system components. We propose basic models for thermodynamic fluid transport and enforce the balance of physical quantities in steady-state flow over co-located outgoing and return networks. We formulate an optimization problem with steam and hot water as the outgoing and return carriers, as in legacy 20th century systems. The physical laws and engineering limitations are specified for each component type, and the thermal network flow optimization (TNFO) problem is formulated and solved for a realistic test network under several scenarios.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 16:57:42 UTC (235 KB)"

In this study, we introduce a comprehensive rubric based on various dimensions of speech quality, including phonetics, fluency, and prosody. The objective is to establish standardized criteria for identifying errors within the speech of individuals with Down syndrome, thereby enabling the development of automated assessment systems. To achieve this objective, we utilized the Prautocal corpus. To assess the quality of annotations using our rubric, two experiments were conducted, focusing on phonetics and fluency. For phonetic evaluation, we employed the Goodness of Pronunciation (GoP) metric, utilizing automatic segmentation systems and correlating the results with evaluations conducted by a specialized speech therapist. While the obtained correlation values were not notably high, a positive trend was observed. In terms of fluency assessment, deep learning models like wav2vec were used to extract audio features, and we employed an SVM classifier trained on a corpus focused on identifying fluency issues to categorize Prautocal corpus samples. The outcomes highlight the complexities of evaluating such phenomena, with variability depending on the specific type of disfluency detected.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 16:44:27 UTC (183 KB)"

Hence, extensive efforts have been devoted to achieving practically usable FL with DP, which however is still challenging.Practitioners often not only are not fully aware of its development and categorization, but also face a hard choice between privacy and utility. Therefore, it calls for a holistic review of current advances and an investigation on the challenges and opportunities for highly usable FL systems with a DP guarantee. In this article, we first introduce the primary concepts of FL and DP, and highlight the benefits of integration. We then review the current developments by categorizing different paradigms and notions. Aiming at usable FL with DP, we present the optimization principles to seek a better tradeoff between model utility and privacy loss. Finally, we discuss future challenges in the emergent areas and relevant research topics.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:51:49 UTC (3,621 KB)"
"5","Location-Based Load Balancing for Energy-Efficient Cell-Free Networks","Robbert Beerten, Vida Ranjbar, Andrea P. Guevara, Hazem Sallouha, Sofie Pollin","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CF mMIMO) has emerged as a potential enabler for future networks. It has been shown that these networks are much more energy-efficient than classical cellular systems when they are serving users at peak capacity. However, these CF mMIMO networks are designed for peak traffic loads, and when this is not the case, they are significantly over-dimensioned and not at all energy efficient. To this end, Adaptive Access Point (AP) ON/OFF Switching (ASO) strategies have been developed to save energy when the network is not at peak traffic loads by putting unnecessary APs to sleep. Unfortunately, the existing strategies rely on measuring channel state information between every user and every access point, resulting in significant measurement energy consumption overheads. Furthermore, the current state-of-art approach has a computational complexity that scales exponentially with the number of APs. In this work, we present a novel convex feasibility testing method that allows checking per-user Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements without necessarily considering all possible access point activations. We then propose an iterative algorithm for activating access points until all users' requirements are fulfilled. We show that our method has comparable performance to the optimal solution whilst avoiding solving costly mixed-integer problems and measuring channel state information on only a limited subset of APs.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:36:13 UTC (74 KB)"

Dawson, Luca Magri","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","When they occur, azimuthal thermoacoustic oscillations can detrimentally affect the safe operation of gas turbines and aeroengines. We develop a real-time digital twin of azimuthal thermoacoustics of a hydrogen-based annular combustor. The digital twin seamlessly combines two sources of information about the system (i) a physics-based low-order model; and (ii) raw and sparse experimental data from microphones, which contain both aleatoric noise and turbulent fluctuations. First, we derive a low-order thermoacoustic model for azimuthal instabilities, which is deterministic. Second, we propose a real-time data assimilation framework to infer the acoustic pressure, the physical parameters, and the model and measurement biases simultaneously. This is the bias-regularized ensemble Kalman filter (r-EnKF), for which we find an analytical solution that solves the optimization problem. Third, we propose a reservoir computer, which infers both the model bias and measurement bias to close the assimilation equations. Fourth, we propose a real-time digital twin of the azimuthal thermoacoustic dynamics of a laboratory hydrogen-based annular combustor for a variety of equivalence ratios. We find that the real-time digital twin (i) autonomously predicts azimuthal dynamics, in contrast to bias-unregularized methods; (ii) uncovers the physical acoustic pressure from the raw data, i.e., it acts as a physics-based filter; (iii) is a time-varying parameter system, which generalizes existing models that have constant parameters, and capture only slow-varying variables. The digital twin generalizes to all equivalence ratios, which bridges the gap of existing models. This work opens new opportunities for real-time digital twinning of multi-physics problems.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:27:09 UTC (5,256 KB)"

However, the robustness of these systems against adversarial attacks, particularly to additive perturbations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we pioneer applying robustness certification techniques to speaker recognition, originally developed for the image domain. In our work, we cover this gap by transferring and improving randomized smoothing certification techniques against norm-bounded additive perturbations for classification and few-shot learning tasks to speaker recognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on VoxCeleb 1 and 2 datasets for several models. We expect this work to improve voice-biometry robustness, establish a new certification benchmark, and accelerate research of certification methods in the audio domain.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:23:26 UTC (397 KB)"

Bidirectional transformation (BX) is an approach to automatically synchronizing these models. However, existing BX frameworks lack formal verification to enforce these models' consistency rigorously. This paper introduces KBX, a formal bidirectional transformation framework for verified model synchronization. First, we present a matching logic-based BX model, providing a logical foundation for constructing BX definitions within the $\mathbb{K}$ framework. Second, we propose algorithms to synthesize formal BX definitions from unidirectional ones, which allows developers to focus on crafting the unidirectional definitions while disregarding the reverse direction and missing information recovery for synchronization. Afterward, we harness $\mathbb{K}$ to generate a formal synchronizer from the synthesized definitions for consistency maintenance and verification. To evaluate the effectiveness of KBX, we conduct a comparative analysis against existing BX frameworks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of KBX in constructing a BX between UML and HCSP for real-world scenarios, showcasing an 82.8\% reduction in BX development effort compared to manual specification writing in $\mathbb{K}$.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:05:27 UTC (2,769 KB)"

Building on previous studies, we have developed a formula to quantify the ions distribution at B-site, incorporating the next-nearest neighbor interactions. Employing molecular field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, the influence of various arrangements of two B-site ions on frustration effects was uncovered. B-site is segmented into a and b-site, defining the number of nearest neighbors from Fea to Feb (and vice versa) as Zx(Zy). The significant frustration effects occur when 1<Zx(or Zy)<3, with Zx is not equal to Zy and also when Zx(or Zy) ~ 3 while Zy(or Zx) ~ 4. All of these are reflected in the variations observed in ground state magnetization and the Thermal Energy Step relation to Zx and Zy. The model proposed in this work can be applied to most B-site disordered in perovskite systems and even to other chemically disordered in frustrated systems.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:48:07 UTC (3,625 KB)"

Conventional image search systems operate by accepting textual or visual queries, retrieving the top-relevant candidate results from the database. However, prevalent methods often rely on single-turn procedures, introducing potential inaccuracies and limited recall. These methods also face the challenges, such as vocabulary mismatch and the semantic gap, constraining their overall effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose an interactive image retrieval system capable of refining queries based on user relevance feedback in a multi-turn setting. This system incorporates a vision language model (VLM) based image captioner to enhance the quality of text-based queries, resulting in more informative queries with each iteration. Moreover, we introduce a large language model (LLM) based denoiser to refine text-based query expansions, mitigating inaccuracies in image descriptions generated by captioning models. To evaluate our system, we curate a new dataset by adapting the MSR-VTT video retrieval dataset to the image retrieval task, offering multiple relevant ground truth images for each query. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed system against baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a notable 10\% improvement in terms of recall. Our contributions encompass the development of an innovative interactive image retrieval system, the integration of an LLM-based denoiser, the curation of a meticulously designed evaluation dataset, and thorough experimental validation.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:46:35 UTC (1,369 KB)"

We show its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion approach are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. Application of this scheme to study strongly correlated molecular systems and localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties for the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in absorption predictions, the method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the accurate prediction of the photoluminescence emission peak.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:36:53 UTC (6,556 KB)"
"13","On the Evaluation of Procedural Level Generation Systems","Oliver Withington, Michael Cook, Laurissa Tokarchuk","Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)","The evaluation of procedural content generation (PCG) systems for generating video game levels is a complex and contested topic. Ideally, the field would have access to robust, generalisable and widely accepted evaluation approaches that can be used to compare novel PCG systems to prior work, but consensus on how to evaluate novel systems is currently limited. We argue that the field can benefit from a structured analysis of how procedural level generation systems can be evaluated, and how these techniques are currently used by researchers. This analysis can then be used to both inform on the current state of affairs, and to provide data to justify changes to this practice. This work aims to provide this by first developing a novel taxonomy of PCG evaluation approaches, and then presenting the results of a survey of recent work in the field through the lens of this taxonomy. The results of this survey highlight several important weaknesses in current practice which we argue could be substantially mitigated by 1) promoting use of evaluation free system descriptions where appropriate, 2) promoting the development of diverse research frameworks, 3) promoting reuse of code and methodology wherever possible.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:40:07 UTC (1,129 KB)"
"14","Efficient preconditioners for coupled Stokes-Darcy problems","Paula Strohbeck, Iryna Rybak","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","Coupled systems of free flow and porous media arise in a variety of technical and environmental applications. For laminar flow regimes, such systems are described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow region and Darcy's law in the porous medium. An appropriate set of coupling conditions is needed on the fluid-porous interface. Discretisations of the Stokes-Darcy problems yield large, sparse, ill-conditioned, and, depending on the interface conditions, non-symmetric linear systems. Therefore, robust and efficient preconditioners are needed to accelerate convergence of the applied Krylov method. In this work, we develop and investigate block diagonal, block triangular and constraint preconditioners for the coupled Stokes-Darcy problems. We apply two classical sets of coupling conditions considering the Beavers-Joseph and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition for the tangential velocity. For the Beavers-Joseph interface condition, the resulting system is non-symmetric, therefore GMRES method is used. Spectral and field-of-values bounds independent of the grid width are derived for the exact versions of the preconditioners. Furthermore, we develop efficient inexact versions of the preconditioners. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed preconditioners in numerical experiments.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:18:02 UTC (4,432 KB)"

An early warning system for complications could provoke clinicians to monitor high-risk patients more carefully and address potential complications early, or inform the patient. In this work, we develop a multimodal deep-learning model for post-operative mortality prediction using pre-operative and per-operative data from elderly hip fracture patients. Specifically, we include static patient data, hip and chest images before surgery in pre-operative data, vital signals, and medications administered during surgery in per-operative data. We extract features from image modalities using ResNet and from vital signals using LSTM. Explainable model outcomes are essential for clinical applicability, therefore we compute Shapley values to explain the predictions of our multimodal black box model. We find that i) Shapley values can be used to estimate the relative contribution of each modality both locally and globally, and ii) a modified version of the chain rule can be used to propagate Shapley values through a sequence of models supporting interpretable local explanations. Our findings imply that a multimodal combination of black box models can be explained by propagating Shapley values through the model sequence.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:11:26 UTC (211 KB)"

This framework aims to go beyond the capabilities of PYFSTAT (which is limited to the PTEMCEE sampler), by allowing a flexible choice of sampling algorithm (using BILBY as a wrapper) and multi-dimensional correlated prior distributions. We show that MCMC and nested sampling methods can recover the maximum posterior point for much bigger parameter-space regions than previously thought (including for sources in binary systems), and we present tests that examine the capabilities of the new framework: a comparison between the DYNESTY, NESSAI, and PTEMCEE samplers, the usage of correlated priors, and its improved computational cost.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 11:22:45 UTC (4,698 KB)"

In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 11:08:44 UTC (130 KB)"

They should (i) answer questions regardless of alterations in table structure, (ii) base their responses on the content of relevant cells rather than on biases, and (iii) demonstrate robust numerical reasoning capabilities. To investigate these aspects, we create and publish a novel TQA evaluation benchmark in English. Our extensive experimental analysis reveals that none of the examined state-of-the-art TQA systems consistently excels in these three aspects.

The solutions represent a gravitational collapse leading to three possible outcomes, depending on the parameter space : (i) a collapse followed by a bounce and dispersal of the clustered matter distribution, (ii) a rapid collapse followed by a bounce and an eventual re-collapse, and (iii) a standard collapse leading to zero proper volume. Profiles of the energy conditions are studied for all of the scenarios, and it is noted that a bounce is usually associated with a violation of the Null Energy Condition. It is found that more than one null surfaces (apparent horizons) can develop during the collapse. We also discuss that for a general metric tensor having a conformal symmetry, some regions of the parameter space allows a formation of null throat, much like a wormhole. Matching the metric with a Schwarzschild metric in Painleve-Gullstrand form leads to the geodesic equation for a zero energy falling particle in the exterior.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 05:13:51 UTC (238 KB)"

The Jive verification system was originally developed to assess the accuracy of public weather forecasts issued by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. It started as a research project in 2015 and gradually evolved into the operational verification system that went live in 2022. The system includes daily verification dashboards for forecasters to visualize recent forecast performance and ""Evidence Targeted Automation"" dashboards for exploring the performance of competing forecast systems. Additionally, there is a Jupyter Notebook server with the Jive Python library which supports research experiments, case studies, and the development of new verification metrics and tools.
This paper shows how the Jive verification project helped bring verification to the forefront at the Bureau of Meteorology, leading to more accurate, streamlined forecasts. Jive has been used to provide evidence for forecast automation decisions and has helped to understand the evolving role of meteorologists in the forecast process. It has given operational meteorologists tools for evaluating forecast processes, including identifying when and how manual interventions lead to superior predictions. The project also led to new verification science, including novel metrics that are decision-focused, including for extreme conditions. Additionally, Jive has provided the Bureau with an enterprise-wide data analysis environment and has prompted a clarification of forecast definitions.

Existing alignment methodologies primarily address single task, such as multi-turn dialogue, coding, mathematical problem-solving, and tool usage. However, AI-driven products that leverage language models usually necessitate a fusion of these abilities to function effectively in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the considerable computational resources required for proper alignment of LLMs underscore the need for a more robust, efficient, and encompassing approach to multi-task alignment, ensuring improved generative performance. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel technique termed Mixture-of-Instructions (MoI), which employs a strategy of instruction concatenation combined with diverse system prompts to boost the alignment efficiency of language models.

For example, under covariate shift, it is assumed that p(y|x) remains invariant. We refer to such distribution shifts as sparse, since they may be substantial but affect only a part of the data generating system. In contrast, in various real-world settings, shifts might be dense. More specifically, these dense distributional shifts may arise through numerous small and random changes in the population and environment. First, we will discuss empirical evidence for such random dense distributional shifts and explain why commonly used models for distribution shifts-including adversarial approaches-may not be appropriate under these conditions. Then, we will develop tools to infer parameters and make predictions for partially observed, shifted distributions. Finally, we will apply the framework to several real-world data sets and discuss diagnostics to evaluate the fit of the distributional uncertainty model.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 02:16:24 UTC (2,311 KB)"

Harald van Brummelen, Ferdinando Auricchio","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","The present paper is concerned with numerical investigation of the performance of a pilot-operated control valve based on shape memory alloy actuation control. The valve under investigation can be integrated into miniaturized hydraulic systems and is developed to perform precise dispensing, mixing, or dosing tasks while being able to withstand relatively high pressure differences. The study evaluates the valve's response under the current ON/OFF and the desired proportional control regimes using numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction. The computational model replicates the operation of the valve, which requires an understanding of the complex interactions between the fluid flow with the pressurized valve and the contact with the valve seat during the opening and closing processes. In addition, the model leverages advanced numerical techniques to overcome several complexities arising mainly from the geometrical, material, and contact nonlinearities, and to mitigate the shortcomings of the partitioned fluid-structure interaction approach. Several simulations are conducted to examine the valve's structural and flow behavior under varying pressure conditions. Results indicate that the valve is adequate for ON/OFF actuation control but is susceptible to flow-induced vibrations during the proportional control regime that occurs due to the sharp pressure drop in the valve-seat gap and the ensuing Venturi effect, which counteract the opening of the main valve. The fluid-structure-interaction simulations provide insight into the mechanism underlying the flow-induced vibrations, which can serve to improve the design and enhance the performance of the valve in microfluidic applications.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 23:33:47 UTC (24,902 KB)"

However, up to now, the vortex state has mainly been studied in microsize ferromagnetic disks, which have oscillation frequencies confined to the GHz range. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible ultrasmall and ultrafast vortex state in an antiferromagnetic nanodot surrounded by a heavy metal, which is further harnessed to construct a highly tunable vortex network. We theoretically demonstrate that, interestingly, the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) induced by the heavy metal at the boundary of the dot acts as an effective chemical potential for the vortices in the interior. Mimicking the creation of a superfluid vortex by rotation, we show that a magnetic vortex state can be stabilized by this iDMI. Subjecting the system to an electric current can trigger vortex oscillations via spin-transfer torque, which reside in the THz regime and can be further modulated by external magnetic fields. Furthermore, we show that coherent coupling between vortices in different nanodisks can be achieved via an antiferromagnetic link. Remarkably, this interaction depends on the vortex polarity and topological charge and is also exceptionally tunable through the vortex resonance frequency. This opens up the possibility for controllable interconnected networks of antiferromagnetic vortices. Our proposal therefore introduces a new avenue for developing high-density memory, ultrafast logic devices, and THz signal generators, which are ideal for compact integration into microchips.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 20:30:11 UTC (3,468 KB)"

The rapid emergence and development of quantum computers offer a promising route to systematically tackle this problem. Recent work by Huggins et al.[1] proposed a hybrid quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) algorithm using Clifford shadows to determine the ground state of a Fermionic Hamiltonian. This approach displayed inherent noise resilience and the potential for improved accuracy compared to its purely classical counterpart. Nevertheless, the use of Clifford shadows introduces an exponentially scaling post-processing cost. In this work, we investigate an improved QC-QMC scheme utilizing the recently developed Matchgate shadows technique [2], which removes the aforementioned exponential bottleneck. We observe from experiments on quantum hardware that the use of Matchgate shadows in QC-QMC is inherently noise robust. We show that this noise resilience has a more subtle origin than in the case of Clifford shadows. Nevertheless, we find that classical post-processing, while asymptotically efficient, requires hours of runtime on thousands of classical CPUs for even the smallest chemical systems, presenting a major challenge to the scalability of the algorithm.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 20:10:49 UTC (2,118 KB)"

This new model addresses a serious unresolved problem in existing trust and reputation models, namely the inability to handle constantly changing behaviors and agents' continuous entry and exit from the system. In previous work, we compared CA to FIRE, a well-known trust and reputation model, and found that CA is superior when the trustor population changes, whereas FIRE is more resilient to the trustee population changes. Thus, in this paper, we investigate how the trustors can detect the presence of several dynamic factors in their environment and then decide which trust model to employ in order to maximize utility. We frame this problem as a machine learning problem in a partially observable environment, where the presence of several dynamic factors is not known to the trustor and we describe how an adaptable trustor can rely on a few measurable features so as to assess the current state of the environment and then use Deep Q Learning (DQN), in a single-agent Reinforcement Learning setting, to learn how to adapt to a changing environment. We ran a series of simulation experiments to compare the performance of the adaptable trustor with the performance of trustors using only one model (FIRE or CA) and we show that an adaptable agent is indeed capable of learning when to use each model and, thus, perform consistently in dynamic environments.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 19:44:56 UTC (2,586 KB)"

Unitary representations of this group describe a wide variety of quantum systems, and have predicted previously unsuspected possibilities; notably, anyons and nonabelian anyons in two space dimensions. We present here foundational reasons why this semidirect product group serves as a universal kinematical group for quantum mechanics. We obtain thus a unified account of all possible quantum kinematics for systems with mass in an arbitrary physical space, and clarify the role played by topology in quantum mechanics. Our development does not require quantization of classical phase space; rather, the classical limit follows from the quantum mechanics.

This complexity stems from factors such as nuanced definitions of fairness, unique biases in each dataset, and the trade-off between fairness and model accuracy. To address such issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach designed to enhance fairness in neural networks by addressing inherent biases at the training stage. FairVIC differs from traditional approaches that typically address biases at the data preprocessing stage. Instead, it integrates variance, invariance and covariance into the loss function to minimise the model's dependency on protected characteristics for making predictions, thus promoting fairness. Our experimentation and evaluation consists of training neural networks on three datasets known for their biases, comparing our results to state-of-the-art algorithms, evaluating on different sizes of model architectures, and carrying out sensitivity analysis to examine the fairness-accuracy trade-off. Through our implementation of FairVIC, we observed a significant improvement in fairness across all metrics tested, without compromising the model's accuracy to a detrimental extent.

This has generated a lot of interest in the field of subdivision space approximation. The quasi-interpolation offers a highly efficient approach for spline approximation, eliminating the necessity of solving large linear systems of equations. Nevertheless, the lack of analytical expressions at extraordinary points on subdivision surfaces makes traditional techniques for creating B-spline quasi-interpolants inappropriate for subdivision spaces. To address this obstacle, this paper innovatively reframes the evaluation issue associated with subdivision surfaces as a correlation between subdivision matrices and limit points, offering a thorough method for quasi-interpolation specifically designed for subdivision surfaces. This developed quasi-interpolant, termed the subdivision space projection operator, accurately reproduces the subdivision space. We provide explicit quasi-interpolation formulas for various typical subdivision schemes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the quasi-interpolants for Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision exhibit third-order approximation in the (L_2) norm and second-order in the (L_\infty) norm.

Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 00:41:57 UTC (12,398 KB)"

Log parsing is the first step in many log-based analyses, that involve extracting structured information from unstructured log data. Traditional log parsers face challenges in accurately parsing logs due to the diversity of log formats, which directly impacts the performance of downstream log-analysis tasks. In this paper, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for log parsing and propose LLMParser, an LLM-based log parser based on generative LLMs and few-shot tuning. We leverage four LLMs, Flan-T5-small, Flan-T5-base, LLaMA-7B, and ChatGLM-6B in LLMParsers. Our evaluation of 16 open-source systems shows that LLMParser achieves statistically significantly higher parsing accuracy than state-of-the-art parsers (a 96% average parsing accuracy). We further conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis on the effect of training size, model size, and pre-training LLM on log parsing accuracy. We find that smaller LLMs may be more effective than more complex LLMs; for instance where Flan-T5-base achieves comparable results as LLaMA-7B with a shorter inference time. We also find that using LLMs pre-trained using logs from other systems does not always improve parsing accuracy. While using pre-trained Flan-T5-base shows an improvement in accuracy, pre-trained LLaMA results in a decrease (decrease by almost 55% in group accuracy). In short, our study provides empirical evidence for using LLMs for log parsing and highlights the limitations and future research direction of LLM-based log parsers.","Sat, 27 Apr 2024 20:34:29 UTC (292 KB)"

Hence, extensive efforts have been devoted to achieving practically usable FL with DP, which however is still challenging.Practitioners often not only are not fully aware of its development and categorization, but also face a hard choice between privacy and utility. Therefore, it calls for a holistic review of current advances and an investigation on the challenges and opportunities for highly usable FL systems with a DP guarantee. In this article, we first introduce the primary concepts of FL and DP, and highlight the benefits of integration. We then review the current developments by categorizing different paradigms and notions. Aiming at usable FL with DP, we present the optimization principles to seek a better tradeoff between model utility and privacy loss. Finally, we discuss future challenges in the emergent areas and relevant research topics.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:51:49 UTC (3,621 KB)"

Guevara, Hazem Sallouha, Sofie Pollin","Signal Processing (eess.SP)","Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CF mMIMO) has emerged as a potential enabler for future networks. It has been shown that these networks are much more energy-efficient than classical cellular systems when they are serving users at peak capacity. However, these CF mMIMO networks are designed for peak traffic loads, and when this is not the case, they are significantly over-dimensioned and not at all energy efficient. To this end, Adaptive Access Point (AP) ON/OFF Switching (ASO) strategies have been developed to save energy when the network is not at peak traffic loads by putting unnecessary APs to sleep. Unfortunately, the existing strategies rely on measuring channel state information between every user and every access point, resulting in significant measurement energy consumption overheads. Furthermore, the current state-of-art approach has a computational complexity that scales exponentially with the number of APs. In this work, we present a novel convex feasibility testing method that allows checking per-user Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements without necessarily considering all possible access point activations. We then propose an iterative algorithm for activating access points until all users' requirements are fulfilled. We show that our method has comparable performance to the optimal solution whilst avoiding solving costly mixed-integer problems and measuring channel state information on only a limited subset of APs.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:36:13 UTC (74 KB)"

Dawson, Luca Magri","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","When they occur, azimuthal thermoacoustic oscillations can detrimentally affect the safe operation of gas turbines and aeroengines. We develop a real-time digital twin of azimuthal thermoacoustics of a hydrogen-based annular combustor. The digital twin seamlessly combines two sources of information about the system (i) a physics-based low-order model; and (ii) raw and sparse experimental data from microphones, which contain both aleatoric noise and turbulent fluctuations. First, we derive a low-order thermoacoustic model for azimuthal instabilities, which is deterministic. Second, we propose a real-time data assimilation framework to infer the acoustic pressure, the physical parameters, and the model and measurement biases simultaneously. This is the bias-regularized ensemble Kalman filter (r-EnKF), for which we find an analytical solution that solves the optimization problem. Third, we propose a reservoir computer, which infers both the model bias and measurement bias to close the assimilation equations. Fourth, we propose a real-time digital twin of the azimuthal thermoacoustic dynamics of a laboratory hydrogen-based annular combustor for a variety of equivalence ratios. We find that the real-time digital twin (i) autonomously predicts azimuthal dynamics, in contrast to bias-unregularized methods; (ii) uncovers the physical acoustic pressure from the raw data, i.e., it acts as a physics-based filter; (iii) is a time-varying parameter system, which generalizes existing models that have constant parameters, and capture only slow-varying variables. The digital twin generalizes to all equivalence ratios, which bridges the gap of existing models. This work opens new opportunities for real-time digital twinning of multi-physics problems.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:27:09 UTC (5,256 KB)"

Bidirectional transformation (BX) is an approach to automatically synchronizing these models. However, existing BX frameworks lack formal verification to enforce these models' consistency rigorously. This paper introduces KBX, a formal bidirectional transformation framework for verified model synchronization. First, we present a matching logic-based BX model, providing a logical foundation for constructing BX definitions within the $\mathbb{K}$ framework. Second, we propose algorithms to synthesize formal BX definitions from unidirectional ones, which allows developers to focus on crafting the unidirectional definitions while disregarding the reverse direction and missing information recovery for synchronization. Afterward, we harness $\mathbb{K}$ to generate a formal synchronizer from the synthesized definitions for consistency maintenance and verification. To evaluate the effectiveness of KBX, we conduct a comparative analysis against existing BX frameworks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of KBX in constructing a BX between UML and HCSP for real-world scenarios, showcasing an 82.8\% reduction in BX development effort compared to manual specification writing in $\mathbb{K}$.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:05:27 UTC (2,769 KB)"

Building on previous studies, we have developed a formula to quantify the ions distribution at B-site, incorporating the next-nearest neighbor interactions. Employing molecular field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, the influence of various arrangements of two B-site ions on frustration effects was uncovered. B-site is segmented into a and b-site, defining the number of nearest neighbors from Fea to Feb (and vice versa) as Zx(Zy). The significant frustration effects occur when 1<Zx(or Zy)<3, with Zx is not equal to Zy and also when Zx(or Zy) ~ 3 while Zy(or Zx) ~ 4. All of these are reflected in the variations observed in ground state magnetization and the Thermal Energy Step relation to Zx and Zy. The model proposed in this work can be applied to most B-site disordered in perovskite systems and even to other chemically disordered in frustrated systems.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:48:07 UTC (3,625 KB)"

Conventional image search systems operate by accepting textual or visual queries, retrieving the top-relevant candidate results from the database. However, prevalent methods often rely on single-turn procedures, introducing potential inaccuracies and limited recall. These methods also face the challenges, such as vocabulary mismatch and the semantic gap, constraining their overall effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose an interactive image retrieval system capable of refining queries based on user relevance feedback in a multi-turn setting. This system incorporates a vision language model (VLM) based image captioner to enhance the quality of text-based queries, resulting in more informative queries with each iteration. Moreover, we introduce a large language model (LLM) based denoiser to refine text-based query expansions, mitigating inaccuracies in image descriptions generated by captioning models. To evaluate our system, we curate a new dataset by adapting the MSR-VTT video retrieval dataset to the image retrieval task, offering multiple relevant ground truth images for each query. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed system against baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a notable 10\% improvement in terms of recall. Our contributions encompass the development of an innovative interactive image retrieval system, the integration of an LLM-based denoiser, the curation of a meticulously designed evaluation dataset, and thorough experimental validation.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:46:35 UTC (1,369 KB)"

We argue that the field can benefit from a structured analysis of how procedural level generation systems can be evaluated, and how these techniques are currently used by researchers. This analysis can then be used to both inform on the current state of affairs, and to provide data to justify changes to this practice. This work aims to provide this by first developing a novel taxonomy of PCG evaluation approaches, and then presenting the results of a survey of recent work in the field through the lens of this taxonomy. The results of this survey highlight several important weaknesses in current practice which we argue could be substantially mitigated by 1) promoting use of evaluation free system descriptions where appropriate, 2) promoting the development of diverse research frameworks, 3) promoting reuse of code and methodology wherever possible.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:40:07 UTC (1,129 KB)"

For laminar flow regimes, such systems are described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow region and Darcy's law in the porous medium. An appropriate set of coupling conditions is needed on the fluid-porous interface. Discretisations of the Stokes-Darcy problems yield large, sparse, ill-conditioned, and, depending on the interface conditions, non-symmetric linear systems. Therefore, robust and efficient preconditioners are needed to accelerate convergence of the applied Krylov method. In this work, we develop and investigate block diagonal, block triangular and constraint preconditioners for the coupled Stokes-Darcy problems. We apply two classical sets of coupling conditions considering the Beavers-Joseph and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition for the tangential velocity. For the Beavers-Joseph interface condition, the resulting system is non-symmetric, therefore GMRES method is used. Spectral and field-of-values bounds independent of the grid width are derived for the exact versions of the preconditioners. Furthermore, we develop efficient inexact versions of the preconditioners. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed preconditioners in numerical experiments.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:18:02 UTC (4,432 KB)"

An early warning system for complications could provoke clinicians to monitor high-risk patients more carefully and address potential complications early, or inform the patient.

Specifically, we include static patient data, hip and chest images before surgery in pre-operative data, vital signals, and medications administered during surgery in per-operative data. We extract features from image modalities using ResNet and from vital signals using LSTM. Explainable model outcomes are essential for clinical applicability, therefore we compute Shapley values to explain the predictions of our multimodal black box model. We find that i) Shapley values can be used to estimate the relative contribution of each modality both locally and globally, and ii) a modified version of the chain rule can be used to propagate Shapley values through a sequence of models supporting interpretable local explanations. Our findings imply that a multimodal combination of black box models can be explained by propagating Shapley values through the model sequence.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:11:26 UTC (211 KB)"

In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 11:08:44 UTC (130 KB)"

Profiles of the energy conditions are studied for all of the scenarios, and it is noted that a bounce is usually associated with a violation of the Null Energy Condition. It is found that more than one null surfaces (apparent horizons) can develop during the collapse. We also discuss that for a general metric tensor having a conformal symmetry, some regions of the parameter space allows a formation of null throat, much like a wormhole.

For example, under covariate shift, it is assumed that p(y|x) remains invariant. We refer to such distribution shifts as sparse, since they may be substantial but affect only a part of the data generating system. In contrast, in various real-world settings, shifts might be dense. More specifically, these dense distributional shifts may arise through numerous small and random changes in the population and environment. First, we will discuss empirical evidence for such random dense distributional shifts and explain why commonly used models for distribution shifts-including adversarial approaches-may not be appropriate under these conditions. Then, we will develop tools to infer parameters and make predictions for partially observed, shifted distributions. Finally, we will apply the framework to several real-world data sets and discuss diagnostics to evaluate the fit of the distributional uncertainty model.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 02:16:24 UTC (2,311 KB)"

Despite the potential of AR glasses, the question of how to display navigation information on the interface of these devices remains a valuable yet relatively unexplored research area. This study employs a mixed-method approach involving 32 participants, combining qualitative feedback from semi-structured interviews with quantitative data from usability questionnaires in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Highlighting the necessity of real-world testing, the research evaluates the impact of five icon placements on the efficiency and effectiveness of information perception in both environments. The experiment results indicate a preference for non-central icon placements, especially bottom-center in real world, which mostly balances distraction and workload for the driver. Moreover, these findings contribute to the formulation of four specific design implications for augmented reality interfaces and systems. This research advances the understanding of AR glasses in driving assistance and sets the stage for further developments in this emerging technology field.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 01:37:11 UTC (3,253 KB)"

Harald van Brummelen, Ferdinando Auricchio","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","The present paper is concerned with numerical investigation of the performance of a pilot-operated control valve based on shape memory alloy actuation control. The valve under investigation can be integrated into miniaturized hydraulic systems and is developed to perform precise dispensing, mixing, or dosing tasks while being able to withstand relatively high pressure differences. The study evaluates the valve's response under the current ON/OFF and the desired proportional control regimes using numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction. The computational model replicates the operation of the valve, which requires an understanding of the complex interactions between the fluid flow with the pressurized valve and the contact with the valve seat during the opening and closing processes. In addition, the model leverages advanced numerical techniques to overcome several complexities arising mainly from the geometrical, material, and contact nonlinearities, and to mitigate the shortcomings of the partitioned fluid-structure interaction approach. Several simulations are conducted to examine the valve's structural and flow behavior under varying pressure conditions. Results indicate that the valve is adequate for ON/OFF actuation control but is susceptible to flow-induced vibrations during the proportional control regime that occurs due to the sharp pressure drop in the valve-seat gap and the ensuing Venturi effect, which counteract the opening of the main valve. The fluid-structure-interaction simulations provide insight into the mechanism underlying the flow-induced vibrations, which can serve to improve the design and enhance the performance of the valve in microfluidic applications.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 23:33:47 UTC (24,902 KB)"

However, up to now, the vortex state has mainly been studied in microsize ferromagnetic disks, which have oscillation frequencies confined to the GHz range. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible ultrasmall and ultrafast vortex state in an antiferromagnetic nanodot surrounded by a heavy metal, which is further harnessed to construct a highly tunable vortex network. We theoretically demonstrate that, interestingly, the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) induced by the heavy metal at the boundary of the dot acts as an effective chemical potential for the vortices in the interior. Mimicking the creation of a superfluid vortex by rotation, we show that a magnetic vortex state can be stabilized by this iDMI. Subjecting the system to an electric current can trigger vortex oscillations via spin-transfer torque, which reside in the THz regime and can be further modulated by external magnetic fields. Furthermore, we show that coherent coupling between vortices in different nanodisks can be achieved via an antiferromagnetic link. Remarkably, this interaction depends on the vortex polarity and topological charge and is also exceptionally tunable through the vortex resonance frequency. This opens up the possibility for controllable interconnected networks of antiferromagnetic vortices. Our proposal therefore introduces a new avenue for developing high-density memory, ultrafast logic devices, and THz signal generators, which are ideal for compact integration into microchips.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 20:30:11 UTC (3,468 KB)"

The rapid emergence and development of quantum computers offer a promising route to systematically tackle this problem. Recent work by Huggins et al.[1] proposed a hybrid quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) algorithm using Clifford shadows to determine the ground state of a Fermionic Hamiltonian. This approach displayed inherent noise resilience and the potential for improved accuracy compared to its purely classical counterpart. Nevertheless, the use of Clifford shadows introduces an exponentially scaling post-processing cost. In this work, we investigate an improved QC-QMC scheme utilizing the recently developed Matchgate shadows technique [2], which removes the aforementioned exponential bottleneck. We observe from experiments on quantum hardware that the use of Matchgate shadows in QC-QMC is inherently noise robust. We show that this noise resilience has a more subtle origin than in the case of Clifford shadows. Nevertheless, we find that classical post-processing, while asymptotically efficient, requires hours of runtime on thousands of classical CPUs for even the smallest chemical systems, presenting a major challenge to the scalability of the algorithm.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 20:10:49 UTC (2,118 KB)"

This new model addresses a serious unresolved problem in existing trust and reputation models, namely the inability to handle constantly changing behaviors and agents' continuous entry and exit from the system. In previous work, we compared CA to FIRE, a well-known trust and reputation model, and found that CA is superior when the trustor population changes, whereas FIRE is more resilient to the trustee population changes. Thus, in this paper, we investigate how the trustors can detect the presence of several dynamic factors in their environment and then decide which trust model to employ in order to maximize utility. We frame this problem as a machine learning problem in a partially observable environment, where the presence of several dynamic factors is not known to the trustor and we describe how an adaptable trustor can rely on a few measurable features so as to assess the current state of the environment and then use Deep Q Learning (DQN), in a single-agent Reinforcement Learning setting, to learn how to adapt to a changing environment. We ran a series of simulation experiments to compare the performance of the adaptable trustor with the performance of trustors using only one model (FIRE or CA) and we show that an adaptable agent is indeed capable of learning when to use each model and, thus, perform consistently in dynamic environments.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 19:44:56 UTC (2,586 KB)"

Unitary representations of this group describe a wide variety of quantum systems, and have predicted previously unsuspected possibilities; notably, anyons and nonabelian anyons in two space dimensions. We present here foundational reasons why this semidirect product group serves as a universal kinematical group for quantum mechanics. We obtain thus a unified account of all possible quantum kinematics for systems with mass in an arbitrary physical space, and clarify the role played by topology in quantum mechanics. Our development does not require quantization of classical phase space; rather, the classical limit follows from the quantum mechanics.

This complexity stems from factors such as nuanced definitions of fairness, unique biases in each dataset, and the trade-off between fairness and model accuracy. To address such issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach designed to enhance fairness in neural networks by addressing inherent biases at the training stage. FairVIC differs from traditional approaches that typically address biases at the data preprocessing stage. Instead, it integrates variance, invariance and covariance into the loss function to minimise the model's dependency on protected characteristics for making predictions, thus promoting fairness. Our experimentation and evaluation consists of training neural networks on three datasets known for their biases, comparing our results to state-of-the-art algorithms, evaluating on different sizes of model architectures, and carrying out sensitivity analysis to examine the fairness-accuracy trade-off. Through our implementation of FairVIC, we observed a significant improvement in fairness across all metrics tested, without compromising the model's accuracy to a detrimental extent. Our findings suggest that FairVIC presents a straightforward, out-of-the-box solution for the development of fairer deep learning models, thereby offering a generalisable solution applicable across many tasks and datasets.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 10:10:21 UTC (386 KB)"

This has generated a lot of interest in the field of subdivision space approximation. The quasi-interpolation offers a highly efficient approach for spline approximation, eliminating the necessity of solving large linear systems of equations. Nevertheless, the lack of analytical expressions at extraordinary points on subdivision surfaces makes traditional techniques for creating B-spline quasi-interpolants inappropriate for subdivision spaces. To address this obstacle, this paper innovatively reframes the evaluation issue associated with subdivision surfaces as a correlation between subdivision matrices and limit points, offering a thorough method for quasi-interpolation specifically designed for subdivision surfaces. This developed quasi-interpolant, termed the subdivision space projection operator, accurately reproduces the subdivision space. We provide explicit quasi-interpolation formulas for various typical subdivision schemes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the quasi-interpolants for Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision exhibit third-order approximation in the (L_2) norm and second-order in the (L_\infty) norm.

Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 00:41:57 UTC (12,398 KB)"

Log parsing is the first step in many log-based analyses, that involve extracting structured information from unstructured log data. Traditional log parsers face challenges in accurately parsing logs due to the diversity of log formats, which directly impacts the performance of downstream log-analysis tasks. In this paper, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for log parsing and propose LLMParser, an LLM-based log parser based on generative LLMs and few-shot tuning. We leverage four LLMs, Flan-T5-small, Flan-T5-base, LLaMA-7B, and ChatGLM-6B in LLMParsers. Our evaluation of 16 open-source systems shows that LLMParser achieves statistically significantly higher parsing accuracy than state-of-the-art parsers (a 96% average parsing accuracy). We further conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis on the effect of training size, model size, and pre-training LLM on log parsing accuracy. We find that smaller LLMs may be more effective than more complex LLMs; for instance where Flan-T5-base achieves comparable results as LLaMA-7B with a shorter inference time. We also find that using LLMs pre-trained using logs from other systems does not always improve parsing accuracy. While using pre-trained Flan-T5-base shows an improvement in accuracy, pre-trained LLaMA results in a decrease (decrease by almost 55% in group accuracy). In short, our study provides empirical evidence for using LLMs for log parsing and highlights the limitations and future research direction of LLM-based log parsers.","Sat, 27 Apr 2024 20:34:29 UTC (292 KB)"

It has been shown that these networks are much more energy-efficient than classical cellular systems when they are serving users at peak capacity. However, these CF mMIMO networks are designed for peak traffic loads, and when this is not the case, they are significantly over-dimensioned and not at all energy efficient. To this end, Adaptive Access Point (AP) ON/OFF Switching (ASO) strategies have been developed to save energy when the network is not at peak traffic loads by putting unnecessary APs to sleep. Unfortunately, the existing strategies rely on measuring channel state information between every user and every access point, resulting in significant measurement energy consumption overheads. Furthermore, the current state-of-art approach has a computational complexity that scales exponentially with the number of APs.

Dawson, Luca Magri","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","When they occur, azimuthal thermoacoustic oscillations can detrimentally affect the safe operation of gas turbines and aeroengines. We develop a real-time digital twin of azimuthal thermoacoustics of a hydrogen-based annular combustor. The digital twin seamlessly combines two sources of information about the system (i) a physics-based low-order model; and (ii) raw and sparse experimental data from microphones, which contain both aleatoric noise and turbulent fluctuations. First, we derive a low-order thermoacoustic model for azimuthal instabilities, which is deterministic. Second, we propose a real-time data assimilation framework to infer the acoustic pressure, the physical parameters, and the model and measurement biases simultaneously. This is the bias-regularized ensemble Kalman filter (r-EnKF), for which we find an analytical solution that solves the optimization problem. Third, we propose a reservoir computer, which infers both the model bias and measurement bias to close the assimilation equations. Fourth, we propose a real-time digital twin of the azimuthal thermoacoustic dynamics of a laboratory hydrogen-based annular combustor for a variety of equivalence ratios. We find that the real-time digital twin (i) autonomously predicts azimuthal dynamics, in contrast to bias-unregularized methods; (ii) uncovers the physical acoustic pressure from the raw data, i.e., it acts as a physics-based filter; (iii) is a time-varying parameter system, which generalizes existing models that have constant parameters, and capture only slow-varying variables. The digital twin generalizes to all equivalence ratios, which bridges the gap of existing models. This work opens new opportunities for real-time digital twinning of multi-physics problems.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:27:09 UTC (5,256 KB)"

Bidirectional transformation (BX) is an approach to automatically synchronizing these models. However, existing BX frameworks lack formal verification to enforce these models' consistency rigorously. This paper introduces KBX, a formal bidirectional transformation framework for verified model synchronization. First, we present a matching logic-based BX model, providing a logical foundation for constructing BX definitions within the $\mathbb{K}$ framework. Second, we propose algorithms to synthesize formal BX definitions from unidirectional ones, which allows developers to focus on crafting the unidirectional definitions while disregarding the reverse direction and missing information recovery for synchronization. Afterward, we harness $\mathbb{K}$ to generate a formal synchronizer from the synthesized definitions for consistency maintenance and verification. To evaluate the effectiveness of KBX, we conduct a comparative analysis against existing BX frameworks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of KBX in constructing a BX between UML and HCSP for real-world scenarios, showcasing an 82.8\% reduction in BX development effort compared to manual specification writing in $\mathbb{K}$.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:05:27 UTC (2,769 KB)"

Building on previous studies, we have developed a formula to quantify the ions distribution at B-site, incorporating the next-nearest neighbor interactions. Employing molecular field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, the influence of various arrangements of two B-site ions on frustration effects was uncovered. B-site is segmented into a and b-site, defining the number of nearest neighbors from Fea to Feb (and vice versa) as Zx(Zy). The significant frustration effects occur when 1<Zx(or Zy)<3, with Zx is not equal to Zy and also when Zx(or Zy) ~ 3 while Zy(or Zx) ~ 4. All of these are reflected in the variations observed in ground state magnetization and the Thermal Energy Step relation to Zx and Zy. The model proposed in this work can be applied to most B-site disordered in perovskite systems and even to other chemically disordered in frustrated systems.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:48:07 UTC (3,625 KB)"

Conventional image search systems operate by accepting textual or visual queries, retrieving the top-relevant candidate results from the database. However, prevalent methods often rely on single-turn procedures, introducing potential inaccuracies and limited recall. These methods also face the challenges, such as vocabulary mismatch and the semantic gap, constraining their overall effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose an interactive image retrieval system capable of refining queries based on user relevance feedback in a multi-turn setting. This system incorporates a vision language model (VLM) based image captioner to enhance the quality of text-based queries, resulting in more informative queries with each iteration. Moreover, we introduce a large language model (LLM) based denoiser to refine text-based query expansions, mitigating inaccuracies in image descriptions generated by captioning models. To evaluate our system, we curate a new dataset by adapting the MSR-VTT video retrieval dataset to the image retrieval task, offering multiple relevant ground truth images for each query. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed system against baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a notable 10\% improvement in terms of recall. Our contributions encompass the development of an innovative interactive image retrieval system, the integration of an LLM-based denoiser, the curation of a meticulously designed evaluation dataset, and thorough experimental validation.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 14:46:35 UTC (1,369 KB)"

Ideally, the field would have access to robust, generalisable and widely accepted evaluation approaches that can be used to compare novel PCG systems to prior work, but consensus on how to evaluate novel systems is currently limited. We argue that the field can benefit from a structured analysis of how procedural level generation systems can be evaluated, and how these techniques are currently used by researchers. This analysis can then be used to both inform on the current state of affairs, and to provide data to justify changes to this practice. This work aims to provide this by first developing a novel taxonomy of PCG evaluation approaches, and then presenting the results of a survey of recent work in the field through the lens of this taxonomy. The results of this survey highlight several important weaknesses in current practice which we argue could be substantially mitigated by 1) promoting use of evaluation free system descriptions where appropriate, 2) promoting the development of diverse research frameworks, 3) promoting reuse of code and methodology wherever possible.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:40:07 UTC (1,129 KB)"

For laminar flow regimes, such systems are described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow region and Darcy's law in the porous medium. An appropriate set of coupling conditions is needed on the fluid-porous interface. Discretisations of the Stokes-Darcy problems yield large, sparse, ill-conditioned, and, depending on the interface conditions, non-symmetric linear systems. Therefore, robust and efficient preconditioners are needed to accelerate convergence of the applied Krylov method. In this work, we develop and investigate block diagonal, block triangular and constraint preconditioners for the coupled Stokes-Darcy problems. We apply two classical sets of coupling conditions considering the Beavers-Joseph and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition for the tangential velocity. For the Beavers-Joseph interface condition, the resulting system is non-symmetric, therefore GMRES method is used. Spectral and field-of-values bounds independent of the grid width are derived for the exact versions of the preconditioners. Furthermore, we develop efficient inexact versions of the preconditioners. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed preconditioners in numerical experiments.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:18:02 UTC (4,432 KB)"

An early warning system for complications could provoke clinicians to monitor high-risk patients more carefully and address potential complications early, or inform the patient.

Specifically, we include static patient data, hip and chest images before surgery in pre-operative data, vital signals, and medications administered during surgery in per-operative data. We extract features from image modalities using ResNet and from vital signals using LSTM. Explainable model outcomes are essential for clinical applicability, therefore we compute Shapley values to explain the predictions of our multimodal black box model. We find that i) Shapley values can be used to estimate the relative contribution of each modality both locally and globally, and ii) a modified version of the chain rule can be used to propagate Shapley values through a sequence of models supporting interpretable local explanations. Our findings imply that a multimodal combination of black box models can be explained by propagating Shapley values through the model sequence.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 12:11:26 UTC (211 KB)"

In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 11:08:44 UTC (130 KB)"

Profiles of the energy conditions are studied for all of the scenarios, and it is noted that a bounce is usually associated with a violation of the Null Energy Condition. It is found that more than one null surfaces (apparent horizons) can develop during the collapse. We also discuss that for a general metric tensor having a conformal symmetry, some regions of the parameter space allows a formation of null throat, much like a wormhole.

This study employs a mixed-method approach involving 32 participants, combining qualitative feedback from semi-structured interviews with quantitative data from usability questionnaires in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Highlighting the necessity of real-world testing, the research evaluates the impact of five icon placements on the efficiency and effectiveness of information perception in both environments. The experiment results indicate a preference for non-central icon placements, especially bottom-center in real world, which mostly balances distraction and workload for the driver. Moreover, these findings contribute to the formulation of four specific design implications for augmented reality interfaces and systems. This research advances the understanding of AR glasses in driving assistance and sets the stage for further developments in this emerging technology field.","Mon, 29 Apr 2024 01:37:11 UTC (3,253 KB)"
"133","Numerical investigation of fluid-structure interaction in a pilot-operated microfluidic valve","Ahmed Aissa Berraies, E. Harald van Brummelen, Ferdinando Auricchio","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","The present paper is concerned with numerical investigation of the performance of a pilot-operated control valve based on shape memory alloy actuation control. The valve under investigation can be integrated into miniaturized hydraulic systems and is developed to perform precise dispensing, mixing, or dosing tasks while being able to withstand relatively high pressure differences. The study evaluates the valve's response under the current ON/OFF and the desired proportional control regimes using numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction. The computational model replicates the operation of the valve, which requires an understanding of the complex interactions between the fluid flow with the pressurized valve and the contact with the valve seat during the opening and closing processes. In addition, the model leverages advanced numerical techniques to overcome several complexities arising mainly from the geometrical, material, and contact nonlinearities, and to mitigate the shortcomings of the partitioned fluid-structure interaction approach. Several simulations are conducted to examine the valve's structural and flow behavior under varying pressure conditions. Results indicate that the valve is adequate for ON/OFF actuation control but is susceptible to flow-induced vibrations during the proportional control regime that occurs due to the sharp pressure drop in the valve-seat gap and the ensuing Venturi effect, which counteract the opening of the main valve. The fluid-structure-interaction simulations provide insight into the mechanism underlying the flow-induced vibrations, which can serve to improve the design and enhance the performance of the valve in microfluidic applications.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 23:33:47 UTC (24,902 KB)"

However, up to now, the vortex state has mainly been studied in microsize ferromagnetic disks, which have oscillation frequencies confined to the GHz range. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible ultrasmall and ultrafast vortex state in an antiferromagnetic nanodot surrounded by a heavy metal, which is further harnessed to construct a highly tunable vortex network. We theoretically demonstrate that, interestingly, the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) induced by the heavy metal at the boundary of the dot acts as an effective chemical potential for the vortices in the interior. Mimicking the creation of a superfluid vortex by rotation, we show that a magnetic vortex state can be stabilized by this iDMI. Subjecting the system to an electric current can trigger vortex oscillations via spin-transfer torque, which reside in the THz regime and can be further modulated by external magnetic fields. Furthermore, we show that coherent coupling between vortices in different nanodisks can be achieved via an antiferromagnetic link. Remarkably, this interaction depends on the vortex polarity and topological charge and is also exceptionally tunable through the vortex resonance frequency. This opens up the possibility for controllable interconnected networks of antiferromagnetic vortices. Our proposal therefore introduces a new avenue for developing high-density memory, ultrafast logic devices, and THz signal generators, which are ideal for compact integration into microchips.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 20:30:11 UTC (3,468 KB)"

The rapid emergence and development of quantum computers offer a promising route to systematically tackle this problem. Recent work by Huggins et al.[1] proposed a hybrid quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) algorithm using Clifford shadows to determine the ground state of a Fermionic Hamiltonian. This approach displayed inherent noise resilience and the potential for improved accuracy compared to its purely classical counterpart. Nevertheless, the use of Clifford shadows introduces an exponentially scaling post-processing cost. In this work, we investigate an improved QC-QMC scheme utilizing the recently developed Matchgate shadows technique [2], which removes the aforementioned exponential bottleneck. We observe from experiments on quantum hardware that the use of Matchgate shadows in QC-QMC is inherently noise robust. We show that this noise resilience has a more subtle origin than in the case of Clifford shadows. Nevertheless, we find that classical post-processing, while asymptotically efficient, requires hours of runtime on thousands of classical CPUs for even the smallest chemical systems, presenting a major challenge to the scalability of the algorithm.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 20:10:49 UTC (2,118 KB)"
"137","Using Deep Q-Learning to Dynamically Toggle between Push/Pull Actions in Computational Trust Mechanisms","Zoi Lygizou, Dimitris Kalles","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Recent work on decentralized computational trust models for open Multi Agent Systems has resulted in the development of CA, a biologically inspired model which focuses on the trustee's perspective. This new model addresses a serious unresolved problem in existing trust and reputation models, namely the inability to handle constantly changing behaviors and agents' continuous entry and exit from the system. In previous work, we compared CA to FIRE, a well-known trust and reputation model, and found that CA is superior when the trustor population changes, whereas FIRE is more resilient to the trustee population changes. Thus, in this paper, we investigate how the trustors can detect the presence of several dynamic factors in their environment and then decide which trust model to employ in order to maximize utility. We frame this problem as a machine learning problem in a partially observable environment, where the presence of several dynamic factors is not known to the trustor and we describe how an adaptable trustor can rely on a few measurable features so as to assess the current state of the environment and then use Deep Q Learning (DQN), in a single-agent Reinforcement Learning setting, to learn how to adapt to a changing environment. We ran a series of simulation experiments to compare the performance of the adaptable trustor with the performance of trustors using only one model (FIRE or CA) and we show that an adaptable agent is indeed capable of learning when to use each model and, thus, perform consistently in dynamic environments.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 19:44:56 UTC (2,586 KB)"

Traditional supervised deep learning methods assume that the test sample is drawn from the identical distribution as the training data. However, it is possible to encounter out-of-distribution samples in real-world clinical scenarios, which may cause silent failure in deep learning-based medical image analysis tasks. Recently, research has explored various out-of-distribution (OOD) detection situations and techniques to enable a trustworthy medical AI system. In this survey, we systematically review the recent advances in OOD detection in medical image analysis. We first explore several factors that may cause a distributional shift when using a deep-learning-based model in clinic scenarios, with three different types of distributional shift well defined on top of these factors. Then a framework is suggested to categorize and feature existing solutions, while the previous studies are reviewed based on the methodology taxonomy.

Sharp","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","In 1968, Dashen and Sharp obtained a certain singular Lie algebra of local densities and currents from canonical commutation relations in nonrelativistic quantum field theory. The corresponding Lie group is infinite dimensional: the natural semidirect product of an additive group of scalar functions with a group of diffeomorphisms. Unitary representations of this group describe a wide variety of quantum systems, and have predicted previously unsuspected possibilities; notably, anyons and nonabelian anyons in two space dimensions. We present here foundational reasons why this semidirect product group serves as a universal kinematical group for quantum mechanics. We obtain thus a unified account of all possible quantum kinematics for systems with mass in an arbitrary physical space, and clarify the role played by topology in quantum mechanics. Our development does not require quantization of classical phase space; rather, the classical limit follows from the quantum mechanics. We also consider the relationship of our development to Heisenberg quantization.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 18:46:24 UTC (21 KB)"

However, the complexities and real-time demands of modern robotics necessitate more efficient communication solutions that are deterministic and isochronous. This article introduces a groundbreaking approach: embedding ROS 2 message-passing infrastructure directly onto a specialized hardware chip, significantly enhancing speed and efficiency in robotic communications. Our FPGA prototypes of the chip design can send or receive packages in less than 2.5 microseconds, accelerating networking communications by more than 62x on average and improving energy consumption by more than 500x when compared to traditional ROS 2 software implementations on modern CPUs. Additionally, it dramatically reduces maximum latency in ROS 2 networking communication by more than 30,000x. In situations of peak latency, our design guarantees an isochronous response within 11 microseconds, a stark improvement over the potential hundreds of milliseconds reported by modern CPU systems under similar conditions.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 15:03:49 UTC (1,408 KB)"

While the general semantics of preference models align well with philosophical intuitions, more constructive characterizations are needed to assess computational complexity and facilitate automated deduction. Existing small model constructions from conditional logics (due to Friedman and Halpern) are applicable only to F+(CM) and G, while recently developed proof-theoretic characterizations leave unresolved the exact complexity of theoremhood in logic F. In this paper, we introduce alternative small model constructions, obtained uniformly for all four Åqvist's logics. Our constructions propose alternative semantical characterizations and imply co-NP-completeness of theoremhood. Furthermore, they can be naturally encoded in classical propositional logic for automated deduction.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 14:57:10 UTC (54 KB)"

The resonance frequency of the system is controlled by both the magnetic field and a set of electrostatic gates. The gates allow us to change both the size of the resonant cavity and the electronic density of the two-dimensional electron gas. We show that we can continuously control the frequency response of our resonator, making it possible to develop an edge magnetoplasmon interferometer. As we reach smaller sizes of our resonator, finite size effects caused by the measurement probes manifest. We present a theoretical description of the system taking into account the spatial extension of the probing gates.

This complexity stems from factors such as nuanced definitions of fairness, unique biases in each dataset, and the trade-off between fairness and model accuracy. To address such issues, we introduce FairVIC, an innovative approach designed to enhance fairness in neural networks by addressing inherent biases at the training stage. FairVIC differs from traditional approaches that typically address biases at the data preprocessing stage. Instead, it integrates variance, invariance and covariance into the loss function to minimise the model's dependency on protected characteristics for making predictions, thus promoting fairness. Our experimentation and evaluation consists of training neural networks on three datasets known for their biases, comparing our results to state-of-the-art algorithms, evaluating on different sizes of model architectures, and carrying out sensitivity analysis to examine the fairness-accuracy trade-off. Through our implementation of FairVIC, we observed a significant improvement in fairness across all metrics tested, without compromising the model's accuracy to a detrimental extent. Our findings suggest that FairVIC presents a straightforward, out-of-the-box solution for the development of fairer deep learning models, thereby offering a generalisable solution applicable across many tasks and datasets.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 10:10:21 UTC (386 KB)"

This has generated a lot of interest in the field of subdivision space approximation. The quasi-interpolation offers a highly efficient approach for spline approximation, eliminating the necessity of solving large linear systems of equations. Nevertheless, the lack of analytical expressions at extraordinary points on subdivision surfaces makes traditional techniques for creating B-spline quasi-interpolants inappropriate for subdivision spaces. To address this obstacle, this paper innovatively reframes the evaluation issue associated with subdivision surfaces as a correlation between subdivision matrices and limit points, offering a thorough method for quasi-interpolation specifically designed for subdivision surfaces. This developed quasi-interpolant, termed the subdivision space projection operator, accurately reproduces the subdivision space. We provide explicit quasi-interpolation formulas for various typical subdivision schemes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the quasi-interpolants for Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision exhibit third-order approximation in the (L_2) norm and second-order in the (L_\infty) norm. Furthermore, the modified Loop subdivision quasi-interpolant achieves optimal approximation rates in both the (L_2) and (L_\infty) norms.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 07:39:18 UTC (2,845 KB)"

Although natural two-dimensional ferroelectrics are few, moiré superlattices provide us with a generalized method to construct ferroelectrics from non-ferroelectric parent materials. We report a realization of ferroelectric hysteresis in a AB-BA stacked twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) system. The ferroelectric polarization is prominent at zero external displacement field and reduces upon increasing displacement fields. TDBG in the AB-BA configuration possesses a superlattice of non-centrosymmetric domains, exhibiting alternatively switchable polarities even without the assistance of any boron nitride layers; however, in the AB-AB stacking case, the development of polarized domains necessitates the presence of a second superlattice induced by the adjacent boron nitride layer.

Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.","Sun, 28 Apr 2024 00:41:57 UTC (12,398 KB)"

Log parsing is the first step in many log-based analyses, that involve extracting structured information from unstructured log data. Traditional log parsers face challenges in accurately parsing logs due to the diversity of log formats, which directly impacts the performance of downstream log-analysis tasks. In this paper, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for log parsing and propose LLMParser, an LLM-based log parser based on generative LLMs and few-shot tuning. We leverage four LLMs, Flan-T5-small, Flan-T5-base, LLaMA-7B, and ChatGLM-6B in LLMParsers. Our evaluation of 16 open-source systems shows that LLMParser achieves statistically significantly higher parsing accuracy than state-of-the-art parsers (a 96% average parsing accuracy). We further conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis on the effect of training size, model size, and pre-training LLM on log parsing accuracy. We find that smaller LLMs may be more effective than more complex LLMs; for instance where Flan-T5-base achieves comparable results as LLaMA-7B with a shorter inference time. We also find that using LLMs pre-trained using logs from other systems does not always improve parsing accuracy. While using pre-trained Flan-T5-base shows an improvement in accuracy, pre-trained LLaMA results in a decrease (decrease by almost 55% in group accuracy). In short, our study provides empirical evidence for using LLMs for log parsing and highlights the limitations and future research direction of LLM-based log parsers.","Sat, 27 Apr 2024 20:34:29 UTC (292 KB)"
