Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.","Tue, 21 May 2024 15:33:21 UTC (3,436 KB)"

We study aperture specifications and scanning parameters by assessing characteristics like size, thickness, and patterns. Numerical experiments assist in assessing their impact on reconstruction quality. Empirical data from a Laue diffraction microscope at a synchrotron undulator beamline supports our findings. Overall, our results offer key insights for optimizing aperture design in advancing micro-scale diffraction imaging at synchrotrons. This study contributes insights to this expanding field and suggests significant advancements, especially when coupled with the enhanced flux anticipated from the global upgrades of synchrotron sources.","Tue, 21 May 2024 14:04:56 UTC (9,103 KB)"

This article proposes a novel framework for implementing, configuring and assessing carbon-aware interactive software services. First, we propose a methodology to implement carbon-aware services leveraging the Strategy design pattern to feature alternative service versions with different energy consumption. Then, we devise a bilevel optimisation scheme to configure which version to use at different times of the day, based on forecasts of carbon intensity and service requests, pursuing the two-fold goal of minimising carbon emissions and maintaining average output quality above a desired set-point. Last, an open-source prototype of such optimisation scheme is used to configure a software service implemented as per our methodology and assessed against traditional non-adaptive implementations of the same service. Results show the capability of our framework to control the average quality of output results of carbon-aware services and to reduce carbon emissions from 8% to 50%.","Tue, 21 May 2024 08:26:38 UTC (2,234 KB)"

Existing multi-RIS works mainly focus on link-level optimization with predetermined transmission paths, which cannot be directly extended to system-level management, since they neither consider the interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, nor the performance balancing between different transmission paths. To address this, we study an innovative multi-hop multi-RIS communication system, where a base station (BS) transmits information to a set of distributed users over multi-RIS configuration space in a multi-hop manner. The signals for each user are subsequently reflected by the selected RISs via multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links. To ensure that all users have fair access to the system to avoid excessive number of RISs serving one user, we aim to find the optimal beam reflecting path for each user, while judiciously determining the path scheduling strategies with the corresponding beamforming design to ensure the fairness. Due to the presence of interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, it is highly challenging to solve the formulated multi-RIS multi-path beamforming optimization problem. To solve it, we first derive the optimal RISs' phase shifts and the corresponding reflecting path selection for each user based on its practical deployment location. With the optimized multi-reflection paths, we obtain a feasible user grouping pattern for effective interference mitigation by constructing the maximum independent sets (MISs). Finally, we propose a joint heuristic algorithm to iteratively update the beamforming vectors and the group scheduling policies to maximize the minimum equivalent data rate of all users.","Tue, 21 May 2024 06:41:24 UTC (3,683 KB)"
"5","PLM4Traj: Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories with Pre-trained Language Models","Zeyu Zhou, Yan Lin, Haomin Wen, Shengnan Guo, Jilin Hu, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Spatio-temporal trajectories play a vital role in various spatio-temporal data mining tasks. Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them.
To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that PLM4Traj successfully achieves its design goals.

However, the demand for a large number of readout channels poses a bottleneck, limiting the application of MPGD to achieve higher accuracy and more extensive area. This requirement also presents significant challenges regarding system integration, power consumption, cooling, and cost.
Previous studies have shown that, under sparse effective hits, a channel multiplexing method based on position encoded can address this issue.
Nonetheless, improving the compression ratio and addressing the high event rate problem remain key challenges requiring further investigation.
In this research, we have developed two types of high compression ratio multiplexing methods and their mathematical models. It is shown that a maximum of $n \times (n-1)/2 - (n - 2)/2 + 1$ detector channels can be read out with n electronics channels if n is even. Using these methods, several multiplexing boards were designed and implemented. Considering the real condition of the detectors, we achieved an multiplexing board with 64 readout electronics reading out 1024 detector channels, marking the highest compression ratio in current research. Moreover, these multiplexing circuits were utilized and verified in our cosmic-ray muon imaging facilities, demonstrating their advantage of reducing the required number of front-end electronics cards.","Tue, 21 May 2024 02:30:13 UTC (1,466 KB)"
"7","Adaptive Extraction Network for Multivariate Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting","Dandan Zhang, Yun Wang","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Models employing CNN architecture have made significant progress in multivariate long sequence time-series forecasting (MLSTF), particularly in modeling local time series characteristics. However, during the MLSTF process, extracting the global time series patterns and understanding the correlations among different variables are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information across different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture correlated features between variables. Building upon this, we propose ATVCNet, an adaptive temporal-variable convolutional network designed to effectively model the local/global temporal dependencies and inter-variable dependencies of multivariate time series. Specifically, extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, captures both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed inter-variable feature adaptive extraction module captures the correlation among different variables in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ATVCNet across eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that ATVCNet achieved a performance improvement of approximately 63.4% over state-of-the-art MLSTF models.","Mon, 20 May 2024 14:05:35 UTC (2,540 KB)"
"8","Quantifying Individual and Joint Module Impact in Modular Optimization Frameworks","Ana Nikolikj, Ana Kostovska, Diederick Vermetten, Carola Doerr, Tome Eftimov","Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)","This study explores the influence of modules on the performance of modular optimization frameworks for continuous single-objective black-box optimization. There is an extensive variety of modules to choose from when designing algorithm variants, however, there is a rather limited understanding of how each module individually influences the algorithm performance and how the modules interact with each other when combined. We use the functional ANOVA (f-ANOVA) framework to quantify the influence of individual modules and module combinations for two algorithms, the modular Covariance Matrix Adaptation (modCMA) and the modular Differential Evolution (modDE). We analyze the performance data from 324 modCMA and 576 modDE variants on the BBOB benchmark collection, for two problem dimensions, and three computational budgets. Noteworthy findings include the identification of important modules that strongly influence the performance of modCMA, such as the~\textit{weights\ option} and~\textit{mirrored} modules for low dimensional problems, and the~\textit{base\ sampler} for high dimensional problems. The large individual influence of the~\textit{lpsr} module makes it very important for the performance of modDE, regardless of the problem dimensionality and the computational budget. When comparing modCMA and modDE, modDE undergoes a shift from individual modules being more influential, to module combinations being more influential, while modCMA follows the opposite pattern, with an increase in problem dimensionality and computational budget.","Mon, 20 May 2024 11:39:55 UTC (1,322 KB)"
"9","Depth Prompting for Sensor-Agnostic Depth Estimation","Jin-Hwi Park, Chanhwi Jeong, Junoh Lee, Hae-Gon Jeon","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Dense depth maps have been used as a key element of visual perception tasks. There have been tremendous efforts to enhance the depth quality, ranging from optimization-based to learning-based methods. Despite the remarkable progress for a long time, their applicability in the real world is limited due to systematic measurement biases such as density, sensing pattern, and scan range. It is well-known that the biases make it difficult for these methods to achieve their generalization. We observe that learning a joint representation for input modalities (e.g., images and depth), which most recent methods adopt, is sensitive to the biases. In this work, we disentangle those modalities to mitigate the biases with prompt engineering. For this, we design a novel depth prompt module to allow the desirable feature representation according to new depth distributions from either sensor types or scene configurations. Our depth prompt can be embedded into foundation models for monocular depth estimation. Through this embedding process, our method helps the pretrained model to be free from restraint of depth scan range and to provide absolute scale depth maps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive evaluations. Source code is publicly available at this https URL .","Mon, 20 May 2024 08:19:08 UTC (26,194 KB)"

We decompose the mean decrease in impurity from the proposed tree model to analyze the additive and interaction effects of features on the response variable. Additionally, we introduce network diagrams to visually depict how each feature contributes additively to the response and how pairs of features contribute interaction effects. Through a detailed demonstration using an embryo growth dataset, we illustrate how the new statistical tools aid data analysis, both visually and numerically. Moreover, we delve into critical aspects of tree modeling, such as prediction performance, inference stability, and bias in feature importance measures, leveraging real datasets and simulation experiments for comprehensive discussions. On the theory side, we show that Collaborative Trees, built upon a ``sum of trees'' approach with our own innovative tree model regularization, exhibit characteristics akin to matching pursuit, under the assumption of high-dimensional independent binary input features (or one-hot feature groups). This newfound link sheds light on the superior capability of our tree model in estimating additive effects of features, a crucial factor for accurate interaction effect estimation.","Sun, 19 May 2024 08:03:13 UTC (1,393 KB)"

However, previous work is reliant on large-scale datasets for training anomaly detection models, which increases the development cost. This paper first focuses on the task of medical image anomaly detection in the few-shot setting, which is critically significant for the medical field where data collection and annotation are both very expensive. We propose an innovative approach, MediCLIP, which adapts the CLIP model to few-shot medical image anomaly detection through self-supervised fine-tuning. Although CLIP, as a vision-language model, demonstrates outstanding zero-/fewshot performance on various downstream tasks, it still falls short in the anomaly detection of medical images. To address this, we design a series of medical image anomaly synthesis tasks to simulate common disease patterns in medical imaging, transferring the powerful generalization capabilities of CLIP to the task of medical image anomaly detection. When only few-shot normal medical images are provided, MediCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and location compared to other methods. Extensive experiments on three distinct medical anomaly detection tasks have demonstrated the superiority of our approach.

The determination of the internal actions caused by external loads in such structures is not an easy task, owing to their high degree of static indeterminacy, and the likelihood of unwanted self-balanced internal actions induced by manufacturing imperfections. Here we present a method for reducing the degree of static indeterminacy which can be applied to several thick origami structures to make them isostatic. The method utilizes sliding hinges, which permit also the relative translation along the hinge axis, to replace conventional hinges. After giving the analytical description of both types of hinges and describing a rigid folding simulation procedure based on the integration of the exponential map, we present the static analysis of a series of noteworthy examples based on the Miura-ori pattern, the Yoshimura pattern, and the Kresling pattern.

Li","Genomics (q-bio.GN)","Similar to natural language models, pre-trained genome language models are proposed to capture the underlying intricacies within genomes with unsupervised sequence modeling. They have become essential tools for researchers and practitioners in biology. However, the \textit{hand-crafted} tokenization policies used in these models may not encode the most discriminative patterns from the limited vocabulary of genomic data. In this paper, we introduce VQDNA, a general-purpose framework that renovates genome tokenization from the perspective of genome vocabulary learning. By leveraging vector-quantized codebook as \textit{learnable} vocabulary, VQDNA can adaptively tokenize genomes into \textit{pattern-aware} embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To further push its limits, we propose Hierarchical Residual Quantization (HRQ), where varying scales of codebooks are designed in a hierarchy to enrich the genome vocabulary in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on 32 genome datasets demonstrate VQDNA's superiority and favorable parameter efficiency compared to existing genome language models.

To handle the inherent complexities of time-series data, such as high dimensionality and noise, traditional supervised learning methods first annotate extensive labels for time-series data in each task, which is very costly and impractical in real-world applications. In contrast, pre-trained foundation models offer a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data to capture general time series patterns, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, existing approaches to pre-training such models typically suffer from high-bias and low-generality issues due to the use of predefined and rigid augmentation operations and domain-specific data training. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces UniCL, a universal and scalable contrastive learning framework designed for pretraining time-series foundation models across cross-domain datasets. Specifically, we propose a unified and trainable time-series augmentation operation to generate pattern-preserved, diverse, and low-bias time-series data by leveraging spectral information. Besides, we introduce a scalable augmentation algorithm capable of handling datasets with varying lengths, facilitating cross-domain pretraining. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across eleven domains validate the effectiveness of UniCL, demonstrating its high generalization on time-series analysis across various fields.","Fri, 17 May 2024 07:47:11 UTC (2,450 KB)"

The inpainting of street-view images is a critical step for street-view image processing, not only for the privacy protection, but also for the urban environment mapping applications. This paper presents a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN), multi-scale semantic prior Feature guided image inpainting Network (MFN) for inpainting street-view images, which generate static street-view images without moving objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). To enhance global context understanding, a semantic prior prompter is introduced to learn rich semantic priors from large pre-trained model. We design the prompter by stacking multiple Semantic Pyramid Aggregation (SPA) modules, capturing a broad range of visual feature patterns. A semantic-enhanced image generator with a decoder is proposed that incorporates a novel cascaded Learnable Prior Transferring (LPT) module at each scale level. For each decoder block, an attention transfer mechanism is applied to capture long-term dependencies, and the semantic prior features are fused with the image features to restore plausible structure in an adaptive manner. Additionally, a background-aware data processing scheme is adopted to prevent the generation of hallucinated objects within holes. Experiments on Apolloscapes and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate better performance than state-of-the-art methods, with MAE, and LPIPS showing improvements of about 9.5% and 41.07% respectively.

However, reasoning accuracy is adversely impacted due to an imbalance between new and recurring events in the datasets. To achieve more accurate TKG reasoning, we propose an attention masking-based contrastive event network (AMCEN) with local-global temporal patterns for the two-stage prediction of future events. In the network, historical and non-historical attention mask vectors are designed to control the attention bias towards historical and non-historical entities, acting as the key to alleviating the imbalance. A local-global message-passing module is proposed to comprehensively consider and capture multi-hop structural dependencies and local-global temporal evolution for the in-depth exploration of latent impact factors of different event types. A contrastive event classifier is used to classify events more accurately by incorporating local-global temporal patterns into contrastive learning. Therefore, AMCEN refines the prediction scope with the results of the contrastive event classification, followed by utilizing attention masking-based decoders to finalize the specific outcomes. The results of our experiments on four benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of AMCEN.

"25","MiniMaxAD: A Lightweight Autoencoder for Feature-Rich Anomaly Detection","Fengjie Wang, Chengming Liu, Lei Shi, Pang Haibo","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Previous unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods often struggle with significant intra-class diversity; i.e., a class in a dataset contains multiple subclasses, which we categorize as Feature-Rich Anomaly Detection Datasets (FRADs). This is evident in applications such as unified setting and unmanned supermarket scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD: a lightweight autoencoder designed to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our model utilizes a large kernel convolutional network equipped with a Global Response Normalization (GRN) unit and employs a multi-scale feature reconstruction strategy. The GRN unit significantly increases the upper limit of the network's capacity, while the large kernel convolution facilitates the extraction of highly abstract patterns, leading to compact normal feature modeling. Additionally, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Loss (ADCLoss), tailored to FRADs to overcome the limitations of global cosine distance loss. MiniMaxAD was comprehensively tested across six challenging UAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results in four and highly competitive outcomes in the remaining two. Notably, our model achieved a detection AUROC of up to 97.0\% in ViSA under the unified setting. Moreover, it not only achieved state-of-the-art performance in unmanned supermarket tasks but also exhibited an inference speed 37 times faster than the previous best method, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex UAD tasks.","Thu, 16 May 2024 09:37:54 UTC (9,196 KB)"

Previous infrared physical attacks mainly focused on 2D infrared pedestrian detection which may not fully manifest its destructiveness to AI systems. In this work, we propose a physical attack method against infrared detectors based on 3D modeling, which is applied to a real car. The goal is to design a set of infrared adversarial stickers to make cars invisible to infrared detectors at various viewing angles, distances, and scenes. We build a 3D infrared car model with real infrared characteristics and propose an infrared adversarial pattern generation method based on 3D mesh shadow. We propose a 3D control points-based mesh smoothing algorithm and use a set of smoothness loss functions to enhance the smoothness of adversarial meshes and facilitate the sticker implementation. Besides, We designed the aluminum stickers and conducted physical experiments on two real Mercedes-Benz A200L cars. Our adversarial stickers hid the cars from Faster RCNN, an object detector, at various viewing angles, distances, and scenes. The attack success rate (ASR) was 91.49% for real cars. In comparison, the ASRs of random stickers and no sticker were only 6.21% and 0.66%, respectively. In addition, the ASRs of the designed stickers against six unseen object detectors such as YOLOv3 and Deformable DETR were between 73.35%-95.80%, showing good transferability of the attack performance across detectors.","Thu, 16 May 2024 09:26:19 UTC (6,993 KB)"

However, the widely utilized hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to the constraints of limited radio frequency chains. Moreover, additional sensing functionalities exacerbate the impairment of spectrum efficiency (SE). In this paper, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC) transceiver design, which spares one RF chain for sensing and the others for communication. To compensate for the reduced SE, index modulation across communication beams is applied. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the sensing beampattern, subject to a symbol MSE constraint. This problem is then solved by sequentially optimizing the analog and digital parts. Both the multi-aperture structure (MAS) and the multi-beam structure (MBS) are considered for the design of the analog part. We conduct theoretical analysis on the asymptotic pairwise error probability (APEP) and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. Numerical simulations validate the overall enhanced ISAC performance over existing alternatives.","Thu, 16 May 2024 02:46:44 UTC (10,113 KB)"

While much of the scientific literature focuses on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that dynamically adjust phase configurations over time, this study takes a different approach by considering low-cost static passive curved EMS (CEMS)s. These are pre-configured during manufacturing to conform to the shape of irregular surfaces, e.g., car doors, effectively transforming them into anomalous mirrors. This design allows vehicles to serve as opportunistic passive relays, mitigating blockage issues in vehicular networks. This paper delves into a novel design method for the phase profile of CEMS based on coarse a-priori distributions of incident and reflection angles onto the surface, influenced by vehicular traffic patterns. A penalty-based method is employed to optimize both the average spectral efficiency (SE) and average coverage probability, and it is compared against a lower-complexity and physically intuitive modular architecture, utilizing a codebook-based discrete optimization technique. Numerical results demonstrate that properly designed CEMS lead to a remarkable improvements in average SE and coverage probability, namely when the direct path is blocked.","Wed, 15 May 2024 23:39:02 UTC (4,632 KB)"

Recently, the concept of fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged, which promotes position flexibility to enable transmitter channel state information (CSI) free spatial multiple access on one radio frequency (RF) chain. On the theoretical side, the fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) approach offers a scalable alternative to massive MIMO spatial multiplexing. However, FAMA lacks experimental validation and the hardware implementation of FAS remains a mysterious approach. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel hardware design for FAS and evaluate the performance of FAMA using experimental data. Our FAS design is based on a dynamically reconfigurable ""fluid"" radiator which is capable of adjusting its position within a predefined space. One single-channel fluid antenna (SCFA) and one double-channel fluid antenna (DCFA) are designed, electromagnetically simulated, fabricated, and measured. The measured radiation patterns of prototypes are imported into channel and network models for evaluating their performance in FAMA. The experimental results demonstrate that in the 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands (24-30 GHz), the FAS prototypes can vary their gain up to an averaged value of 11 dBi. In the case of 4-user FAMA, the double-channel FAS can significantly reduce outage probability by 57% and increases the multiplexing gain to 2.27 when compared to a static omnidirectional antenna.","Wed, 15 May 2024 19:08:04 UTC (7,338 KB)"

However, estimating coefficients does not directly solve the problem of prediction with missing entries: a manner to address empty components must be designed. Major approaches to deal with prediction with missing values are empirically driven and can be decomposed into two families: imputation (filling in empty fields) and pattern-by-pattern prediction, where a predictor is built on each missing pattern. Unfortunately, most simple imputation techniques used in practice (as constant imputation) are not consistent when combined with linear models. In this paper, we focus on the more flexible pattern-by-pattern approaches and study their predictive performances on Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) data. We first show that a pattern-by-pattern logistic regression model is intrinsically ill-defined, implying that even classical logistic regression is impossible to apply to missing data. We then analyze the perceptron model and show how the linear separability property extends to partially-observed inputs. Finally, we use the Linear Discriminant Analysis to prove that pattern-by-pattern LDA is consistent in a high-dimensional regime. We refine our analysis to more complex MNAR data.","Wed, 15 May 2024 09:08:22 UTC (58 KB)"

We contribute to this issue by generalizing the idea of curriculum learning beyond its original formulation, i.e., training models using easier-to-harder data. Specifically, we reformulate the training curriculum as a soft-selection function, which uncovers progressively more difficult patterns within each example during training, instead of performing easier-to-harder sample selection. Our work is inspired by an intriguing observation on the learning dynamics of visual backbones: during the earlier stages of training, the model predominantly learns to recognize some 'easier-to-learn' discriminative patterns in the data. These patterns, when observed through frequency and spatial domains, incorporate lower-frequency components, and the natural image contents without distortion or data augmentation. Motivated by these findings, we propose a curriculum where the model always leverages all the training data at every learning stage, yet the exposure to the 'easier-to-learn' patterns of each example is initiated first, with harder patterns gradually introduced as training progresses. To implement this idea in a computationally efficient way, we introduce a cropping operation in the Fourier spectrum of the inputs, enabling the model to learn from only the lower-frequency components. Then we show that exposing the contents of natural images can be readily achieved by modulating the intensity of data augmentation. Finally, we integrate these aspects and design curriculum schedules with tailored search algorithms. The resulting method, EfficientTrain++, is simple, general, yet surprisingly effective. It reduces the training time of a wide variety of popular models by 1.5-3.0x on ImageNet-1K/22K without sacrificing accuracy. It also demonstrates efficacy in self-supervised learning (e.g., MAE).","Tue, 14 May 2024 17:00:43 UTC (15,942 KB)"

The rapid evolution of various industries has amplified the demand for estimation frameworks that satisfy all these factors. This study introduces a neuromorphic approach for robust filtering of nonlinear dynamical systems: SNN-EMSIF (spiking neural network-extended modified sliding innovation filter). SNN-EMSIF combines the computational efficiency and scalability of SNNs with the robustness of EMSIF, an estimation framework designed for nonlinear systems with zero-mean Gaussian noise. Notably, the weight matrices are designed according to the system model, eliminating the need for a learning process. The framework's efficacy is evaluated through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing SNN-EMSIF with EKF and EMSIF. Additionally, it is compared with SNN-EKF in the presence of modeling uncertainties and neuron loss, using RMSEs as a metric. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of SNN-EMSIF. Further analysis of runtimes and spiking patterns reveals an impressive reduction of 85% in emitted spikes compared to possible spikes, highlighting the computational efficiency of SNN-EMSIF.

Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. We believe that the multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.","Mon, 13 May 2024 16:08:53 UTC (9,661 KB)[v2] Tue, 14 May 2024 14:47:25 UTC (9,661 KB)"

In this paper, we study this problem by cooperating with the rich knowledge encoded in large language models(LLMs) and propose a method, namely AnomalyLLM. To align the dynamic graph with LLMs, AnomalyLLM pre-trains a dynamic-aware encoder to generate the representations of edges and reprograms the edges using the prototypes of word embeddings. Along with the encoder, we design an in-context learning framework that integrates the information of a few labeled samples to achieve few-shot anomaly detection. Experiments on four datasets reveal that AnomalyLLM can not only significantly improve the performance of few-shot anomaly detection, but also achieve superior results on new anomalies without any update of model parameters.","Mon, 13 May 2024 10:37:50 UTC (1,918 KB)"

This study introduces a simplified, abstract random walk model designed to produce inverse square Lévy walks, also known as Cauchy walks and explores the conditions that facilitate these phenomena. In our model, agents move toward a randomly selected destination in multi-dimensional space, and their movement strategy is parameterized by the extent to which they pursue the shortest path. When the search cost is proportional to the distance traveled, this parameter effectively reflects the emphasis on minimizing search costs. Our findings reveal that strict adherence to this cost minimization constraint results in a Brownian walk pattern.

By adjusting the nanophotonic pattern and hence the bandgap, the ratio of output OPO wave frequency span to required pump laser tuning is more than 10,000. We also demonstrate tuning the oscillator in free-spectral-range steps, more finely with temperature, and minimal additive frequency noise of the laser-conversion process.

Finite nuclear mass effects and the coupling between the internal atomic structure and the motion of the atom across the magnetic field are also considered. Synthetic fluxes are generated with integrations of numerical solutions of polarized radiative transfer over the visible stellar disk using a spherical t-design method. The atmosphere code is tested with observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for a group of known magnetic white dwarfs. Physical stellar parameters are obtained from least-squares fits to the observed energy distribution and compared with results of previous works. We show that the use of zerofield ionization equilibrium in spectral analyses can lead to underestimated effective temperatures for highly magnetic white dwarfs.","Fri, 10 May 2024 17:03:27 UTC (1,702 KB)[v2] Fri, 17 May 2024 17:28:52 UTC (1,702 KB)"
"50","Automatic Structural Search of Tensor Network States including Entanglement Renormalization","Ryo Watanabe, Hiroshi Ueda","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Tensor network (TN) states, including entanglement renormalization (ER), can encompass a wider variety of entangled states. When the entanglement structure of the quantum state of interest is non-uniform in real space, accurately representing the state with a limited number of degrees of freedom hinges on appropriately configuring the TN to align with the entanglement pattern. However, a proposal has yet to show a structural search of ER due to its high computational cost and the lack of flexibility in its algorithm. In this study, we conducted an optimal structural search of TN, including ER, based on the reconstruction of their local structures with respect to variational energy. Firstly, we demonstrated that our algorithm for the spin-$1/2$ tetramer singlets model could calculate exact ground energy using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) structure as an initial TN structure. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to the random XY models with the two initial structures: MERA and the suitable structure underlying the strong disordered renormalization group. We found that, in both cases, our algorithm achieves improvements in variational energy, fidelity, and entanglement entropy. The degree of improvement in these quantities is superior in the latter case compared to the former, suggesting that utilizing an existing TN design method as a preprocessing step is important for maximizing our algorithm's performance.","Fri, 10 May 2024 15:24:10 UTC (1,217 KB)"

Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.","Tue, 21 May 2024 15:33:21 UTC (3,436 KB)"

Existing multi-RIS works mainly focus on link-level optimization with predetermined transmission paths, which cannot be directly extended to system-level management, since they neither consider the interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, nor the performance balancing between different transmission paths. To address this, we study an innovative multi-hop multi-RIS communication system, where a base station (BS) transmits information to a set of distributed users over multi-RIS configuration space in a multi-hop manner. The signals for each user are subsequently reflected by the selected RISs via multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links. To ensure that all users have fair access to the system to avoid excessive number of RISs serving one user, we aim to find the optimal beam reflecting path for each user, while judiciously determining the path scheduling strategies with the corresponding beamforming design to ensure the fairness. Due to the presence of interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, it is highly challenging to solve the formulated multi-RIS multi-path beamforming optimization problem. To solve it, we first derive the optimal RISs' phase shifts and the corresponding reflecting path selection for each user based on its practical deployment location. With the optimized multi-reflection paths, we obtain a feasible user grouping pattern for effective interference mitigation by constructing the maximum independent sets (MISs). Finally, we propose a joint heuristic algorithm to iteratively update the beamforming vectors and the group scheduling policies to maximize the minimum equivalent data rate of all users.","Tue, 21 May 2024 06:41:24 UTC (3,683 KB)"

Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them.
To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks.

However, the demand for a large number of readout channels poses a bottleneck, limiting the application of MPGD to achieve higher accuracy and more extensive area. This requirement also presents significant challenges regarding system integration, power consumption, cooling, and cost.
Previous studies have shown that, under sparse effective hits, a channel multiplexing method based on position encoded can address this issue.
Nonetheless, improving the compression ratio and addressing the high event rate problem remain key challenges requiring further investigation.
In this research, we have developed two types of high compression ratio multiplexing methods and their mathematical models. It is shown that a maximum of $n \times (n-1)/2 - (n - 2)/2 + 1$ detector channels can be read out with n electronics channels if n is even. Using these methods, several multiplexing boards were designed and implemented. Considering the real condition of the detectors, we achieved an multiplexing board with 64 readout electronics reading out 1024 detector channels, marking the highest compression ratio in current research. Moreover, these multiplexing circuits were utilized and verified in our cosmic-ray muon imaging facilities, demonstrating their advantage of reducing the required number of front-end electronics cards.","Tue, 21 May 2024 02:30:13 UTC (1,466 KB)"

However, during the MLSTF process, extracting the global time series patterns and understanding the correlations among different variables are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information across different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture correlated features between variables. Building upon this, we propose ATVCNet, an adaptive temporal-variable convolutional network designed to effectively model the local/global temporal dependencies and inter-variable dependencies of multivariate time series. Specifically, extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, captures both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed inter-variable feature adaptive extraction module captures the correlation among different variables in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ATVCNet across eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that ATVCNet achieved a performance improvement of approximately 63.4% over state-of-the-art MLSTF models.","Mon, 20 May 2024 14:05:35 UTC (2,540 KB)"

There is an extensive variety of modules to choose from when designing algorithm variants, however, there is a rather limited understanding of how each module individually influences the algorithm performance and how the modules interact with each other when combined. We use the functional ANOVA (f-ANOVA) framework to quantify the influence of individual modules and module combinations for two algorithms, the modular Covariance Matrix Adaptation (modCMA) and the modular Differential Evolution (modDE). We analyze the performance data from 324 modCMA and 576 modDE variants on the BBOB benchmark collection, for two problem dimensions, and three computational budgets. Noteworthy findings include the identification of important modules that strongly influence the performance of modCMA, such as the~\textit{weights\ option} and~\textit{mirrored} modules for low dimensional problems, and the~\textit{base\ sampler} for high dimensional problems. The large individual influence of the~\textit{lpsr} module makes it very important for the performance of modDE, regardless of the problem dimensionality and the computational budget.

There have been tremendous efforts to enhance the depth quality, ranging from optimization-based to learning-based methods. Despite the remarkable progress for a long time, their applicability in the real world is limited due to systematic measurement biases such as density, sensing pattern, and scan range. It is well-known that the biases make it difficult for these methods to achieve their generalization. We observe that learning a joint representation for input modalities (e.g., images and depth), which most recent methods adopt, is sensitive to the biases. In this work, we disentangle those modalities to mitigate the biases with prompt engineering. For this, we design a novel depth prompt module to allow the desirable feature representation according to new depth distributions from either sensor types or scene configurations. Our depth prompt can be embedded into foundation models for monocular depth estimation. Through this embedding process, our method helps the pretrained model to be free from restraint of depth scan range and to provide absolute scale depth maps.

To achieve more accurate TKG reasoning, we propose an attention masking-based contrastive event network (AMCEN) with local-global temporal patterns for the two-stage prediction of future events. In the network, historical and non-historical attention mask vectors are designed to control the attention bias towards historical and non-historical entities, acting as the key to alleviating the imbalance. A local-global message-passing module is proposed to comprehensively consider and capture multi-hop structural dependencies and local-global temporal evolution for the in-depth exploration of latent impact factors of different event types. A contrastive event classifier is used to classify events more accurately by incorporating local-global temporal patterns into contrastive learning.

The decoupled vision system decouples inner-modal modeling and cross-modal interaction, yielding unique visual information modeling and effective cross-modal comprehension. Libra is trained through discrete auto-regressive modeling on both vision and language inputs. Specifically, we incorporate a routed visual expert with a cross-modal bridge module into a pretrained LLM to route the vision and language flows during attention computing to enable different attention patterns in inner-modal modeling and cross-modal interaction scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the dedicated design of Libra achieves a strong MLLM baseline that rivals existing works in the image-to-text scenario with merely 50 million training data, providing a new perspective for future multimodal foundation models.

An end-to-end scheme is used to inverse design the metasurface for projecting off-chip preset multiple patterns. Particular examples are presented for customized patterns that were encoded into the metasurface with a single-cell meta-atom, working simultaneously at RGB color channels and for several different diffractive distance, with polarization dependence.

This is evident in applications such as unified setting and unmanned supermarket scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD: a lightweight autoencoder designed to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our model utilizes a large kernel convolutional network equipped with a Global Response Normalization (GRN) unit and employs a multi-scale feature reconstruction strategy. The GRN unit significantly increases the upper limit of the network's capacity, while the large kernel convolution facilitates the extraction of highly abstract patterns, leading to compact normal feature modeling. Additionally, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Loss (ADCLoss), tailored to FRADs to overcome the limitations of global cosine distance loss. MiniMaxAD was comprehensively tested across six challenging UAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results in four and highly competitive outcomes in the remaining two. Notably, our model achieved a detection AUROC of up to 97.0\% in ViSA under the unified setting. Moreover, it not only achieved state-of-the-art performance in unmanned supermarket tasks but also exhibited an inference speed 37 times faster than the previous best method, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex UAD tasks.","Thu, 16 May 2024 09:37:54 UTC (9,196 KB)"

Previous infrared physical attacks mainly focused on 2D infrared pedestrian detection which may not fully manifest its destructiveness to AI systems. In this work, we propose a physical attack method against infrared detectors based on 3D modeling, which is applied to a real car. The goal is to design a set of infrared adversarial stickers to make cars invisible to infrared detectors at various viewing angles, distances, and scenes. We build a 3D infrared car model with real infrared characteristics and propose an infrared adversarial pattern generation method based on 3D mesh shadow. We propose a 3D control points-based mesh smoothing algorithm and use a set of smoothness loss functions to enhance the smoothness of adversarial meshes and facilitate the sticker implementation. Besides, We designed the aluminum stickers and conducted physical experiments on two real Mercedes-Benz A200L cars. Our adversarial stickers hid the cars from Faster RCNN, an object detector, at various viewing angles, distances, and scenes. The attack success rate (ASR) was 91.49% for real cars. In comparison, the ASRs of random stickers and no sticker were only 6.21% and 0.66%, respectively. In addition, the ASRs of the designed stickers against six unseen object detectors such as YOLOv3 and Deformable DETR were between 73.35%-95.80%, showing good transferability of the attack performance across detectors.","Thu, 16 May 2024 09:26:19 UTC (6,993 KB)"

However, the widely utilized hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to the constraints of limited radio frequency chains. Moreover, additional sensing functionalities exacerbate the impairment of spectrum efficiency (SE). In this paper, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC) transceiver design, which spares one RF chain for sensing and the others for communication. To compensate for the reduced SE, index modulation across communication beams is applied. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the sensing beampattern, subject to a symbol MSE constraint. This problem is then solved by sequentially optimizing the analog and digital parts. Both the multi-aperture structure (MAS) and the multi-beam structure (MBS) are considered for the design of the analog part. We conduct theoretical analysis on the asymptotic pairwise error probability (APEP) and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. Numerical simulations validate the overall enhanced ISAC performance over existing alternatives.","Thu, 16 May 2024 02:46:44 UTC (10,113 KB)"

While much of the scientific literature focuses on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that dynamically adjust phase configurations over time, this study takes a different approach by considering low-cost static passive curved EMS (CEMS)s. These are pre-configured during manufacturing to conform to the shape of irregular surfaces, e.g., car doors, effectively transforming them into anomalous mirrors. This design allows vehicles to serve as opportunistic passive relays, mitigating blockage issues in vehicular networks. This paper delves into a novel design method for the phase profile of CEMS based on coarse a-priori distributions of incident and reflection angles onto the surface, influenced by vehicular traffic patterns. A penalty-based method is employed to optimize both the average spectral efficiency (SE) and average coverage probability, and it is compared against a lower-complexity and physically intuitive modular architecture, utilizing a codebook-based discrete optimization technique. Numerical results demonstrate that properly designed CEMS lead to a remarkable improvements in average SE and coverage probability, namely when the direct path is blocked.","Wed, 15 May 2024 23:39:02 UTC (4,632 KB)"

Recently, the concept of fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged, which promotes position flexibility to enable transmitter channel state information (CSI) free spatial multiple access on one radio frequency (RF) chain. On the theoretical side, the fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) approach offers a scalable alternative to massive MIMO spatial multiplexing. However, FAMA lacks experimental validation and the hardware implementation of FAS remains a mysterious approach. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel hardware design for FAS and evaluate the performance of FAMA using experimental data. Our FAS design is based on a dynamically reconfigurable ""fluid"" radiator which is capable of adjusting its position within a predefined space. One single-channel fluid antenna (SCFA) and one double-channel fluid antenna (DCFA) are designed, electromagnetically simulated, fabricated, and measured. The measured radiation patterns of prototypes are imported into channel and network models for evaluating their performance in FAMA. The experimental results demonstrate that in the 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands (24-30 GHz), the FAS prototypes can vary their gain up to an averaged value of 11 dBi. In the case of 4-user FAMA, the double-channel FAS can significantly reduce outage probability by 57% and increases the multiplexing gain to 2.27 when compared to a static omnidirectional antenna.","Wed, 15 May 2024 19:08:04 UTC (7,338 KB)"

However, estimating coefficients does not directly solve the problem of prediction with missing entries: a manner to address empty components must be designed. Major approaches to deal with prediction with missing values are empirically driven and can be decomposed into two families: imputation (filling in empty fields) and pattern-by-pattern prediction, where a predictor is built on each missing pattern. Unfortunately, most simple imputation techniques used in practice (as constant imputation) are not consistent when combined with linear models. In this paper, we focus on the more flexible pattern-by-pattern approaches and study their predictive performances on Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) data. We first show that a pattern-by-pattern logistic regression model is intrinsically ill-defined, implying that even classical logistic regression is impossible to apply to missing data. We then analyze the perceptron model and show how the linear separability property extends to partially-observed inputs. Finally, we use the Linear Discriminant Analysis to prove that pattern-by-pattern LDA is consistent in a high-dimensional regime. We refine our analysis to more complex MNAR data.","Wed, 15 May 2024 09:08:22 UTC (58 KB)"

We contribute to this issue by generalizing the idea of curriculum learning beyond its original formulation, i.e., training models using easier-to-harder data. Specifically, we reformulate the training curriculum as a soft-selection function, which uncovers progressively more difficult patterns within each example during training, instead of performing easier-to-harder sample selection. Our work is inspired by an intriguing observation on the learning dynamics of visual backbones: during the earlier stages of training, the model predominantly learns to recognize some 'easier-to-learn' discriminative patterns in the data. These patterns, when observed through frequency and spatial domains, incorporate lower-frequency components, and the natural image contents without distortion or data augmentation. Motivated by these findings, we propose a curriculum where the model always leverages all the training data at every learning stage, yet the exposure to the 'easier-to-learn' patterns of each example is initiated first, with harder patterns gradually introduced as training progresses. To implement this idea in a computationally efficient way, we introduce a cropping operation in the Fourier spectrum of the inputs, enabling the model to learn from only the lower-frequency components. Then we show that exposing the contents of natural images can be readily achieved by modulating the intensity of data augmentation. Finally, we integrate these aspects and design curriculum schedules with tailored search algorithms. The resulting method, EfficientTrain++, is simple, general, yet surprisingly effective. It reduces the training time of a wide variety of popular models by 1.5-3.0x on ImageNet-1K/22K without sacrificing accuracy. It also demonstrates efficacy in self-supervised learning (e.g., MAE).","Tue, 14 May 2024 17:00:43 UTC (15,942 KB)"

The rapid evolution of various industries has amplified the demand for estimation frameworks that satisfy all these factors. This study introduces a neuromorphic approach for robust filtering of nonlinear dynamical systems: SNN-EMSIF (spiking neural network-extended modified sliding innovation filter). SNN-EMSIF combines the computational efficiency and scalability of SNNs with the robustness of EMSIF, an estimation framework designed for nonlinear systems with zero-mean Gaussian noise. Notably, the weight matrices are designed according to the system model, eliminating the need for a learning process. The framework's efficacy is evaluated through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing SNN-EMSIF with EKF and EMSIF. Additionally, it is compared with SNN-EKF in the presence of modeling uncertainties and neuron loss, using RMSEs as a metric. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of SNN-EMSIF. Further analysis of runtimes and spiking patterns reveals an impressive reduction of 85% in emitted spikes compared to possible spikes, highlighting the computational efficiency of SNN-EMSIF.

Our approach extends the recently developed high-frequency homogenization theory of hyperuniform media and retrieves more general permittivity profiles for applications-relevant finite-size SHU systems, unveiling unique features related to their isotropic nature. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of a transparency region beyond the long-wavelength approximation, enabling effective and isotropic homogenization even without disorder-averaging, in contrast to the case of uncorrelated Poisson random patterns. We believe that the multiscale network approach introduced here enables the efficient inverse design of general effective media and finite-size metamaterials with isotropic electromagnetic responses beyond the limitations of traditional homogenization theories.","Mon, 13 May 2024 16:08:53 UTC (9,661 KB)[v2] Tue, 14 May 2024 14:47:25 UTC (9,661 KB)"

In this paper, we study this problem by cooperating with the rich knowledge encoded in large language models(LLMs) and propose a method, namely AnomalyLLM. To align the dynamic graph with LLMs, AnomalyLLM pre-trains a dynamic-aware encoder to generate the representations of edges and reprograms the edges using the prototypes of word embeddings. Along with the encoder, we design an in-context learning framework that integrates the information of a few labeled samples to achieve few-shot anomaly detection.

This study introduces a simplified, abstract random walk model designed to produce inverse square Lévy walks, also known as Cauchy walks and explores the conditions that facilitate these phenomena. In our model, agents move toward a randomly selected destination in multi-dimensional space, and their movement strategy is parameterized by the extent to which they pursue the shortest path. When the search cost is proportional to the distance traveled, this parameter effectively reflects the emphasis on minimizing search costs. Our findings reveal that strict adherence to this cost minimization constraint results in a Brownian walk pattern.

By adjusting the nanophotonic pattern and hence the bandgap, the ratio of output OPO wave frequency span to required pump laser tuning is more than 10,000. We also demonstrate tuning the oscillator in free-spectral-range steps, more finely with temperature, and minimal additive frequency noise of the laser-conversion process. Our work shows that nanophotonics offers control of laser conversion in microresonators, bridging phase-matching of nonlinear optics and application requirements for laser designs.","Fri, 10 May 2024 18:03:11 UTC (641 KB)"

Rohrmann","Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)","We present a new magnetic-atmosphere model code for obtaining synthetic spectral fluxes of hydrogen-rich magnetic white dwarfs. To date, observed spectra have been analyzed with models that neglect the magnetic field's effects on the atomic populations. In this work, we incorporate state-of-art theory in the evaluation of numerical densities of atoms, free electrons, and ions in local thermodynamical equilibrium under the action of a magnetic field. The energy distribution of atoms is rigorously evaluated for arbitrary field strength. This energy pattern includes going from tightly bound states to metastable or truly bound, highly excited states embedded in the continuum, that is, over the first Landau level. Finite nuclear mass effects and the coupling between the internal atomic structure and the motion of the atom across the magnetic field are also considered. Synthetic fluxes are generated with integrations of numerical solutions of polarized radiative transfer over the visible stellar disk using a spherical t-design method. The atmosphere code is tested with observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for a group of known magnetic white dwarfs. Physical stellar parameters are obtained from least-squares fits to the observed energy distribution and compared with results of previous works. We show that the use of zerofield ionization equilibrium in spectral analyses can lead to underestimated effective temperatures for highly magnetic white dwarfs.","Fri, 10 May 2024 17:03:27 UTC (1,702 KB)[v2] Fri, 17 May 2024 17:28:52 UTC (1,702 KB)"
"100","Automatic Structural Search of Tensor Network States including Entanglement Renormalization","Ryo Watanabe, Hiroshi Ueda","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Tensor network (TN) states, including entanglement renormalization (ER), can encompass a wider variety of entangled states. When the entanglement structure of the quantum state of interest is non-uniform in real space, accurately representing the state with a limited number of degrees of freedom hinges on appropriately configuring the TN to align with the entanglement pattern. However, a proposal has yet to show a structural search of ER due to its high computational cost and the lack of flexibility in its algorithm. In this study, we conducted an optimal structural search of TN, including ER, based on the reconstruction of their local structures with respect to variational energy. Firstly, we demonstrated that our algorithm for the spin-$1/2$ tetramer singlets model could calculate exact ground energy using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) structure as an initial TN structure. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to the random XY models with the two initial structures: MERA and the suitable structure underlying the strong disordered renormalization group. We found that, in both cases, our algorithm achieves improvements in variational energy, fidelity, and entanglement entropy. The degree of improvement in these quantities is superior in the latter case compared to the former, suggesting that utilizing an existing TN design method as a preprocessing step is important for maximizing our algorithm's performance.","Fri, 10 May 2024 15:24:10 UTC (1,217 KB)"

Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message.

Existing multi-RIS works mainly focus on link-level optimization with predetermined transmission paths, which cannot be directly extended to system-level management, since they neither consider the interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, nor the performance balancing between different transmission paths. To address this, we study an innovative multi-hop multi-RIS communication system, where a base station (BS) transmits information to a set of distributed users over multi-RIS configuration space in a multi-hop manner. The signals for each user are subsequently reflected by the selected RISs via multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links. To ensure that all users have fair access to the system to avoid excessive number of RISs serving one user, we aim to find the optimal beam reflecting path for each user, while judiciously determining the path scheduling strategies with the corresponding beamforming design to ensure the fairness. Due to the presence of interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, it is highly challenging to solve the formulated multi-RIS multi-path beamforming optimization problem. To solve it, we first derive the optimal RISs' phase shifts and the corresponding reflecting path selection for each user based on its practical deployment location. With the optimized multi-reflection paths, we obtain a feasible user grouping pattern for effective interference mitigation by constructing the maximum independent sets (MISs). Finally, we propose a joint heuristic algorithm to iteratively update the beamforming vectors and the group scheduling policies to maximize the minimum equivalent data rate of all users.","Tue, 21 May 2024 06:41:24 UTC (3,683 KB)"

Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them.
To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks.

However, the demand for a large number of readout channels poses a bottleneck, limiting the application of MPGD to achieve higher accuracy and more extensive area. This requirement also presents significant challenges regarding system integration, power consumption, cooling, and cost.
Previous studies have shown that, under sparse effective hits, a channel multiplexing method based on position encoded can address this issue.
Nonetheless, improving the compression ratio and addressing the high event rate problem remain key challenges requiring further investigation.
In this research, we have developed two types of high compression ratio multiplexing methods and their mathematical models. It is shown that a maximum of $n \times (n-1)/2 - (n - 2)/2 + 1$ detector channels can be read out with n electronics channels if n is even. Using these methods, several multiplexing boards were designed and implemented. Considering the real condition of the detectors, we achieved an multiplexing board with 64 readout electronics reading out 1024 detector channels, marking the highest compression ratio in current research. Moreover, these multiplexing circuits were utilized and verified in our cosmic-ray muon imaging facilities, demonstrating their advantage of reducing the required number of front-end electronics cards.","Tue, 21 May 2024 02:30:13 UTC (1,466 KB)"

However, during the MLSTF process, extracting the global time series patterns and understanding the correlations among different variables are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information across different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture correlated features between variables. Building upon this, we propose ATVCNet, an adaptive temporal-variable convolutional network designed to effectively model the local/global temporal dependencies and inter-variable dependencies of multivariate time series. Specifically, extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, captures both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed inter-variable feature adaptive extraction module captures the correlation among different variables in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ATVCNet across eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that ATVCNet achieved a performance improvement of approximately 63.4% over state-of-the-art MLSTF models.","Mon, 20 May 2024 14:05:35 UTC (2,540 KB)"

There is an extensive variety of modules to choose from when designing algorithm variants, however, there is a rather limited understanding of how each module individually influences the algorithm performance and how the modules interact with each other when combined. We use the functional ANOVA (f-ANOVA) framework to quantify the influence of individual modules and module combinations for two algorithms, the modular Covariance Matrix Adaptation (modCMA) and the modular Differential Evolution (modDE). We analyze the performance data from 324 modCMA and 576 modDE variants on the BBOB benchmark collection, for two problem dimensions, and three computational budgets. Noteworthy findings include the identification of important modules that strongly influence the performance of modCMA, such as the~\textit{weights\ option} and~\textit{mirrored} modules for low dimensional problems, and the~\textit{base\ sampler} for high dimensional problems. The large individual influence of the~\textit{lpsr} module makes it very important for the performance of modDE, regardless of the problem dimensionality and the computational budget.

There have been tremendous efforts to enhance the depth quality, ranging from optimization-based to learning-based methods. Despite the remarkable progress for a long time, their applicability in the real world is limited due to systematic measurement biases such as density, sensing pattern, and scan range. It is well-known that the biases make it difficult for these methods to achieve their generalization. We observe that learning a joint representation for input modalities (e.g., images and depth), which most recent methods adopt, is sensitive to the biases. In this work, we disentangle those modalities to mitigate the biases with prompt engineering. For this, we design a novel depth prompt module to allow the desirable feature representation according to new depth distributions from either sensor types or scene configurations. Our depth prompt can be embedded into foundation models for monocular depth estimation.

To achieve more accurate TKG reasoning, we propose an attention masking-based contrastive event network (AMCEN) with local-global temporal patterns for the two-stage prediction of future events. In the network, historical and non-historical attention mask vectors are designed to control the attention bias towards historical and non-historical entities, acting as the key to alleviating the imbalance. A local-global message-passing module is proposed to comprehensively consider and capture multi-hop structural dependencies and local-global temporal evolution for the in-depth exploration of latent impact factors of different event types. A contrastive event classifier is used to classify events more accurately by incorporating local-global temporal patterns into contrastive learning. Therefore, AMCEN refines the prediction scope with the results of the contrastive event classification, followed by utilizing attention masking-based decoders to finalize the specific outcomes. The results of our experiments on four benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of AMCEN. Especially, the considerable improvements in Hits@1 prove that AMCEN can make more precise predictions about future occurrences.","Thu, 16 May 2024 01:39:50 UTC (1,576 KB)"

We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions.

This is evident in applications such as unified setting and unmanned supermarket scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD: a lightweight autoencoder designed to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our model utilizes a large kernel convolutional network equipped with a Global Response Normalization (GRN) unit and employs a multi-scale feature reconstruction strategy. The GRN unit significantly increases the upper limit of the network's capacity, while the large kernel convolution facilitates the extraction of highly abstract patterns, leading to compact normal feature modeling. Additionally, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Loss (ADCLoss), tailored to FRADs to overcome the limitations of global cosine distance loss. MiniMaxAD was comprehensively tested across six challenging UAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results in four and highly competitive outcomes in the remaining two. Notably, our model achieved a detection AUROC of up to 97.0\% in ViSA under the unified setting. Moreover, it not only achieved state-of-the-art performance in unmanned supermarket tasks but also exhibited an inference speed 37 times faster than the previous best method, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex UAD tasks.","Thu, 16 May 2024 09:37:54 UTC (9,196 KB)"

Previous infrared physical attacks mainly focused on 2D infrared pedestrian detection which may not fully manifest its destructiveness to AI systems. In this work, we propose a physical attack method against infrared detectors based on 3D modeling, which is applied to a real car. The goal is to design a set of infrared adversarial stickers to make cars invisible to infrared detectors at various viewing angles, distances, and scenes. We build a 3D infrared car model with real infrared characteristics and propose an infrared adversarial pattern generation method based on 3D mesh shadow. We propose a 3D control points-based mesh smoothing algorithm and use a set of smoothness loss functions to enhance the smoothness of adversarial meshes and facilitate the sticker implementation. Besides, We designed the aluminum stickers and conducted physical experiments on two real Mercedes-Benz A200L cars. Our adversarial stickers hid the cars from Faster RCNN, an object detector, at various viewing angles, distances, and scenes. The attack success rate (ASR) was 91.49% for real cars. In comparison, the ASRs of random stickers and no sticker were only 6.21% and 0.66%, respectively.

However, the widely utilized hybrid architecture in mmWave systems compromises multiplexing gain due to the constraints of limited radio frequency chains. Moreover, additional sensing functionalities exacerbate the impairment of spectrum efficiency (SE). In this paper, we present an optimized beam pattern modulation-embedded ISAC (BPM-ISAC) transceiver design, which spares one RF chain for sensing and the others for communication. To compensate for the reduced SE, index modulation across communication beams is applied. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the sensing beampattern, subject to a symbol MSE constraint. This problem is then solved by sequentially optimizing the analog and digital parts. Both the multi-aperture structure (MAS) and the multi-beam structure (MBS) are considered for the design of the analog part. We conduct theoretical analysis on the asymptotic pairwise error probability (APEP) and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. Numerical simulations validate the overall enhanced ISAC performance over existing alternatives.","Thu, 16 May 2024 02:46:44 UTC (10,113 KB)"

While much of the scientific literature focuses on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that dynamically adjust phase configurations over time, this study takes a different approach by considering low-cost static passive curved EMS (CEMS)s. These are pre-configured during manufacturing to conform to the shape of irregular surfaces, e.g., car doors, effectively transforming them into anomalous mirrors. This design allows vehicles to serve as opportunistic passive relays, mitigating blockage issues in vehicular networks. This paper delves into a novel design method for the phase profile of CEMS based on coarse a-priori distributions of incident and reflection angles onto the surface, influenced by vehicular traffic patterns. A penalty-based method is employed to optimize both the average spectral efficiency (SE) and average coverage probability, and it is compared against a lower-complexity and physically intuitive modular architecture, utilizing a codebook-based discrete optimization technique. Numerical results demonstrate that properly designed CEMS lead to a remarkable improvements in average SE and coverage probability, namely when the direct path is blocked.","Wed, 15 May 2024 23:39:02 UTC (4,632 KB)"

Recently, the concept of fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged, which promotes position flexibility to enable transmitter channel state information (CSI) free spatial multiple access on one radio frequency (RF) chain. On the theoretical side, the fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) approach offers a scalable alternative to massive MIMO spatial multiplexing. However, FAMA lacks experimental validation and the hardware implementation of FAS remains a mysterious approach. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel hardware design for FAS and evaluate the performance of FAMA using experimental data. Our FAS design is based on a dynamically reconfigurable ""fluid"" radiator which is capable of adjusting its position within a predefined space. One single-channel fluid antenna (SCFA) and one double-channel fluid antenna (DCFA) are designed, electromagnetically simulated, fabricated, and measured. The measured radiation patterns of prototypes are imported into channel and network models for evaluating their performance in FAMA. The experimental results demonstrate that in the 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands (24-30 GHz), the FAS prototypes can vary their gain up to an averaged value of 11 dBi. In the case of 4-user FAMA, the double-channel FAS can significantly reduce outage probability by 57% and increases the multiplexing gain to 2.27 when compared to a static omnidirectional antenna.","Wed, 15 May 2024 19:08:04 UTC (7,338 KB)"

However, estimating coefficients does not directly solve the problem of prediction with missing entries: a manner to address empty components must be designed. Major approaches to deal with prediction with missing values are empirically driven and can be decomposed into two families: imputation (filling in empty fields) and pattern-by-pattern prediction, where a predictor is built on each missing pattern. Unfortunately, most simple imputation techniques used in practice (as constant imputation) are not consistent when combined with linear models. In this paper, we focus on the more flexible pattern-by-pattern approaches and study their predictive performances on Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) data. We first show that a pattern-by-pattern logistic regression model is intrinsically ill-defined, implying that even classical logistic regression is impossible to apply to missing data. We then analyze the perceptron model and show how the linear separability property extends to partially-observed inputs. Finally, we use the Linear Discriminant Analysis to prove that pattern-by-pattern LDA is consistent in a high-dimensional regime. We refine our analysis to more complex MNAR data.","Wed, 15 May 2024 09:08:22 UTC (58 KB)"

We contribute to this issue by generalizing the idea of curriculum learning beyond its original formulation, i.e., training models using easier-to-harder data. Specifically, we reformulate the training curriculum as a soft-selection function, which uncovers progressively more difficult patterns within each example during training, instead of performing easier-to-harder sample selection. Our work is inspired by an intriguing observation on the learning dynamics of visual backbones: during the earlier stages of training, the model predominantly learns to recognize some 'easier-to-learn' discriminative patterns in the data. These patterns, when observed through frequency and spatial domains, incorporate lower-frequency components, and the natural image contents without distortion or data augmentation. Motivated by these findings, we propose a curriculum where the model always leverages all the training data at every learning stage, yet the exposure to the 'easier-to-learn' patterns of each example is initiated first, with harder patterns gradually introduced as training progresses. To implement this idea in a computationally efficient way, we introduce a cropping operation in the Fourier spectrum of the inputs, enabling the model to learn from only the lower-frequency components. Then we show that exposing the contents of natural images can be readily achieved by modulating the intensity of data augmentation. Finally, we integrate these aspects and design curriculum schedules with tailored search algorithms. The resulting method, EfficientTrain++, is simple, general, yet surprisingly effective. It reduces the training time of a wide variety of popular models by 1.5-3.0x on ImageNet-1K/22K without sacrificing accuracy. It also demonstrates efficacy in self-supervised learning (e.g., MAE).","Tue, 14 May 2024 17:00:43 UTC (15,942 KB)"

The rapid evolution of various industries has amplified the demand for estimation frameworks that satisfy all these factors. This study introduces a neuromorphic approach for robust filtering of nonlinear dynamical systems: SNN-EMSIF (spiking neural network-extended modified sliding innovation filter). SNN-EMSIF combines the computational efficiency and scalability of SNNs with the robustness of EMSIF, an estimation framework designed for nonlinear systems with zero-mean Gaussian noise. Notably, the weight matrices are designed according to the system model, eliminating the need for a learning process. The framework's efficacy is evaluated through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing SNN-EMSIF with EKF and EMSIF. Additionally, it is compared with SNN-EKF in the presence of modeling uncertainties and neuron loss, using RMSEs as a metric. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of SNN-EMSIF. Further analysis of runtimes and spiking patterns reveals an impressive reduction of 85% in emitted spikes compared to possible spikes, highlighting the computational efficiency of SNN-EMSIF.

In this paper, we study this problem by cooperating with the rich knowledge encoded in large language models(LLMs) and propose a method, namely AnomalyLLM. To align the dynamic graph with LLMs, AnomalyLLM pre-trains a dynamic-aware encoder to generate the representations of edges and reprograms the edges using the prototypes of word embeddings.

Notably, Lévy walks with power exponents close to two are frequently observed, though their underlying causes remain elusive. This study introduces a simplified, abstract random walk model designed to produce inverse square Lévy walks, also known as Cauchy walks and explores the conditions that facilitate these phenomena. In our model, agents move toward a randomly selected destination in multi-dimensional space, and their movement strategy is parameterized by the extent to which they pursue the shortest path. When the search cost is proportional to the distance traveled, this parameter effectively reflects the emphasis on minimizing search costs. Our findings reveal that strict adherence to this cost minimization constraint results in a Brownian walk pattern. However, removing this constraint transitions the movement to an inverse square Lévy walk. Therefore, by modulating the prioritization of search costs, our model can seamlessly alternate between Brownian and Cauchy walk dynamics.

These relationships are shown to be invertible, allowing us to design complex curved geometries. Our framework enables porting knowledge, methods and tools from continuum theories of matter and differential geometry to the field of origami metamaterials.","Sun, 12 May 2024 10:53:58 UTC (5,124 KB)"
"146","Chained Flexible Capsule Endoscope: Unraveling the Conundrum of Size Limitations and Functional Integration for Gastrointestinal Transitivity","Sishen Yuan, Guang Li, Baijia Liang, Lailu Li, Qingzhuo Zheng, Shuang Song, Zhen Li, Hongliang Ren","Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)","Capsule endoscopes, predominantly serving diagnostic functions, provide lucid internal imagery but are devoid of surgical or therapeutic capabilities. Consequently, despite lesion detection, physicians frequently resort to traditional endoscopic or open surgical procedures for treatment, resulting in more complex, potentially risky interventions. To surmount these limitations, this study introduces a chained flexible capsule endoscope (FCE) design concept, specifically conceived to navigate the inherent volume constraints of capsule endoscopes whilst augmenting their therapeutic functionalities. The FCE's distinctive flexibility originates from a conventional rotating joint design and the incision pattern in the flexible material. In vitro experiments validated the passive navigation ability of the FCE in rugged intestinal tracts. Further, the FCE demonstrates consistent reptile-like peristalsis under the influence of an external magnetic field, and possesses the capability for film expansion and disintegration under high-frequency electromagnetic stimulation. These findings illuminate a promising path toward amplifying the therapeutic capacities of capsule endoscopes without necessitating a size compromise.","Sun, 12 May 2024 08:42:05 UTC (40,947 KB)"

Papp","Optics (physics.optics)","Many uses of lasers place the highest importance on access to specific wavelength bands. For example, mobilizing optical-atomic clocks for a leap in sensing requires compact lasers at frequencies spread across the visible and near infrared. Integrated photonics enables high-performance, scalable laser platforms, however, customizing laser-gain media to support wholly new bands is challenging and often prohibitively mismatched in scalability to early quantum-based sensing and information systems. Here, we demonstrate a microresonator optical-parametric oscillator (OPO) that converts a pump laser to an output wave within a frequency span exceeding an octave. We achieve phase matching for oscillation by nanopatterning the microresonator to open a photonic-crystal bandgap on the mode of the pump laser. By adjusting the nanophotonic pattern and hence the bandgap, the ratio of output OPO wave frequency span to required pump laser tuning is more than 10,000. We also demonstrate tuning the oscillator in free-spectral-range steps, more finely with temperature, and minimal additive frequency noise of the laser-conversion process. Our work shows that nanophotonics offers control of laser conversion in microresonators, bridging phase-matching of nonlinear optics and application requirements for laser designs.","Fri, 10 May 2024 18:03:11 UTC (641 KB)"

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary research field that primarily uses computational methods to analyze large amounts of biological macromolecule data. Its goal is to discover hidden biological patterns and related information. Furthermore, analysing additional relevant information can enhance the study of biological operating mechanisms. This paper discusses the fundamental concepts of RNA, RNA secondary structure, and its prediction.Subsequently, the application of machine learning technologies in predicting the structure of biological macromolecules is explored. This chapter describes the relevant knowledge of algorithms and computational complexity and presents a RNA tertiary structure prediction algorithm based on ResNet. To address the issue of the current scoring function's unsuitability for long RNA, a scoring model based on ResNet is proposed, and a structure prediction algorithm is designed. The chapter concludes by presenting some open and interesting challenges in the field of RNA tertiary structure prediction.","Sun, 14 Apr 2024 08:36:14 UTC (969 KB)"
"149","A numerical code for the analysis of magnetic white dwarf spectra that includes field effects on the chemical equilibrium","Matías Vera-Rueda, René D. Rohrmann","Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)","We present a new magnetic-atmosphere model code for obtaining synthetic spectral fluxes of hydrogen-rich magnetic white dwarfs. To date, observed spectra have been analyzed with models that neglect the magnetic field's effects on the atomic populations. In this work, we incorporate state-of-art theory in the evaluation of numerical densities of atoms, free electrons, and ions in local thermodynamical equilibrium under the action of a magnetic field. The energy distribution of atoms is rigorously evaluated for arbitrary field strength. This energy pattern includes going from tightly bound states to metastable or truly bound, highly excited states embedded in the continuum, that is, over the first Landau level. Finite nuclear mass effects and the coupling between the internal atomic structure and the motion of the atom across the magnetic field are also considered. Synthetic fluxes are generated with integrations of numerical solutions of polarized radiative transfer over the visible stellar disk using a spherical t-design method. The atmosphere code is tested with observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for a group of known magnetic white dwarfs. Physical stellar parameters are obtained from least-squares fits to the observed energy distribution and compared with results of previous works. We show that the use of zerofield ionization equilibrium in spectral analyses can lead to underestimated effective temperatures for highly magnetic white dwarfs.","Fri, 10 May 2024 17:03:27 UTC (1,702 KB)[v2] Fri, 17 May 2024 17:28:52 UTC (1,702 KB)"
"150","Automatic Structural Search of Tensor Network States including Entanglement Renormalization","Ryo Watanabe, Hiroshi Ueda","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Tensor network (TN) states, including entanglement renormalization (ER), can encompass a wider variety of entangled states. When the entanglement structure of the quantum state of interest is non-uniform in real space, accurately representing the state with a limited number of degrees of freedom hinges on appropriately configuring the TN to align with the entanglement pattern. However, a proposal has yet to show a structural search of ER due to its high computational cost and the lack of flexibility in its algorithm. In this study, we conducted an optimal structural search of TN, including ER, based on the reconstruction of their local structures with respect to variational energy. Firstly, we demonstrated that our algorithm for the spin-$1/2$ tetramer singlets model could calculate exact ground energy using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) structure as an initial TN structure. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to the random XY models with the two initial structures: MERA and the suitable structure underlying the strong disordered renormalization group. We found that, in both cases, our algorithm achieves improvements in variational energy, fidelity, and entanglement entropy. The degree of improvement in these quantities is superior in the latter case compared to the former, suggesting that utilizing an existing TN design method as a preprocessing step is important for maximizing our algorithm's performance.","Fri, 10 May 2024 15:24:10 UTC (1,217 KB)"
