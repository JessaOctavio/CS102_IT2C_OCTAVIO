It suggested I order size 10 and because they stretch, they would probably fit, but I ordered 12 and they do fit perfectly (including length). I plan to also order them in black and purple.

"13","Pants","VIPONES Bell Bottom Jeans for Women High Waisted Flare Jeans Ripped Denim Pants","Dara Harvey","When I first put these on they were fantastic except I couldn‚Äôt begin to zip or button the waist. So I kept them on and wore them unzipped and unbuttoned around the house for about 2 hours. They began to stretch. I took them off, put them on next morning and I could actually zip and button them. They are still stretching to fit. If you get yours and have the same problem at first, they may not be too small, just too new.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 5 April 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"17","Pants","VIPONES Bell Bottom Jeans for Women High Waisted Flare Jeans Ripped Denim Pants","Mary A. Lee","I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality of these jeans. Let me start off by saying that they are Long! Very Long! But, I am 5' 1"" so everything I buy has to be hemmed.  They are so soft yet durable feeling with just enough stretch to make them comfortable in any position you find yourself. I am plus-size (20) with excess weight in my upper thighs due to Lipidema so I tried these because of the advertised ""baggy straight leg"" and they fit PERFECTLY! So much so that I ran to the computer and ordered another pair!! Skinny Jeans they are not! But they are also not big baggy no style pants.  They actually make my butt look great!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 6 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"28","Pants","VIPONES Bell Bottom Jeans for Women High Waisted Flare Jeans Ripped Denim Pants","unitydienes","First off, the size chart is accurate. I ordered a 10 even though I was pretty sure I needed an 8, just because I was following the size chart. I'm glad I did, because these 10s fit perfectly. I guess maybe other vendors are vanity sizing! These fit slim through the waist and thighs but really flare out below the knees for a classic bell-bottom look. They're not really the modern ""wide leg"" look, but they are a bell-bottom.The color is a really intense, bright purple. It's not professional or muted, but rather a fun and eye-catching denim. These are for fun wear, like when you want to make a bit of a splash. They have a long inseam. I'm 5'4"" and they are a bit long/baggy on me. Shorter people might be overwhelmed by them.  If you like wearing heels with jeans, these jeans can handle that.I'm not sure what I think of the double button on top, but it's just another funky detail to these quirky jeans. I like the look overall and think these are well-made and a good value.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 23 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"36","Pants","VIPONES Bell Bottom Jeans for Women High Waisted Flare Jeans Ripped Denim Pants","goccirich","I got these for my teen daughter, she is 5'9 and weighs 110lbs (purchased size S, color Cyan). They fit her pretty well besides being a bit shorter than she would like, but it's nothing new and not unexpected since she has this problem with most jeans because of how tall and skinny she is. Besides that she found these jeans extremely comfortable. The material is very nice and quite soft & stretchy for jeans. They look really nice on her and the color is super vibrant.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 31 May 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"39","Pants","VIPONES Bell Bottom Jeans for Women High Waisted Flare Jeans Ripped Denim Pants","Kbutty","These are really cute jeans. Unfortunately, I am just not very shapely from the waist down, so it fit snug on my waist, but too loose in the butt, thigh, and knee area. I couldn't go smaller as it would be too tight in the waist, which fit true to size in my case. So if you have no butt and small thighs, this could be tricky for you... If you are between sizes and stuff seems to fit you tighter in the butt/loose in the waist, def size down and these would be perfect for you! Hope that helps!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 7 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The color is beautiful and lots of compliments! Add to cart and bite the bullet. The length is perfect, I am 5‚Äô2 and always wear a small heel and it lays perfectly not too short. They have belt loops so you can add a belt to them if needed.
