"1","Pants","Leggings Depot","Pamela","I now have a number of these pants as they are so comfortable and a nice colour range.  The fabric is soft but not see through and stretchy but stays in shape.  The length is long, so I had to take them up but as I am petite that is to be expected.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 7 February 2024","4.4 out of 5 stars"

"15","Pants","Leggings Depot","JoD","I have 2 pairs of Lulu Align Joggers that cost me $130. I love the fabric and the way they look. These are basically the same thing. Minor differences... you can feel the seams a bit more and the fabric feels a little less - only a little - buttery. But for the money, this is a steal. Love them, I don't see me buying any others from now on.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 10 May 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"18","Pants","Leggings Depot","Saif Islam","Sadly had to return. The size felt like a it was on the smaller side of a large. I could‚Äôve kept them, but I don‚Äôt care for garments that hug my body. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2  and 176lbs usually wear a 12/14 in most items. The feel and comfort of these are outstanding, so blame soft. The nicest pair of joggers I‚Äôve ever seen and so many patterns and most around $10-$12, who does that, that‚Äôs why once I returned and went to order them in an xl they had none I tell ya.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 November 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"20","Pants","Leggings Depot","Pookums65","These leggings are great! They fit as expected, are soft and comfortable. I used to be a LuLaRoe addict with leggings. But these leggings fit, are just as soft, and comfortable as the LuLa leggings at 1/2 the price.

"25","Pants","Leggings Depot","Torri Lambert","I love these leggings to death, I would buy 100 of them if I could. I'm 5 ft 6 167 lbs with a very athletic build, I bought the plus size and they fit great but anyone thinner might wanna choose the regular size unless u like a looser fit. So soft and adorable print too!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 7 June 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"26","Pants","Leggings Depot","Jonathan and Amy Holmes","Inexpensive, high waisted, very soft and comfortable, and cute.  I'm 5'4"" and wear a size 16 in jeans or a 14 in skinny jeans.  These fit just fine, but with extra length at the ankles.  They still look good, but I do think they'd work fine for someone 6 feet tall as well.  I've washed them a handful of times and experienced zero fading or pilling.  I'd love to have them in every design, and think depending on the design they can be dressed up or down.  They also would work great for yoga, the gym, or pjs around the house.  I'm very happy with mine.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 January 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"27","Pants","Leggings Depot","ILOVEMYDOGS","I have ordered from this company many times before with pleasant results. I ordered a light blue color this time and I was surprised that they were fairly see through. I will probably just wear them around the house or with a shirt long enough to cover my bum. They are still comfortable and soft.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 15 November 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"30","Pants","Leggings Depot","Lyndi","I love these pants! They are so soft and comfy. I wanted something I could wear around the house and run to the store in. The colors are vibrant and they are well made. I don't like anything tight around my belly, and these aren't. They are also flattering in their fit. I'm ordering more!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 17 January 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"31","Pants","Leggings Depot","Pamela","Love the pattern and the buttery soft feel.  I bought the plus size because that‚Äôs all they had left.  I thought they might be too big, but actually they are a tad snug.  They didn‚Äôt quite come up as high around my waist as I like but they are for sure wearable for me.  I was a bit surprised by the fit.  I usually buy the ‚Äúone size.‚Äù","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 7 February 2024","4.4 out of 5 stars"

"37","Pants","Leggings Depot","Judith E.","They were exactly as expected. I wore them for a Race for the Cure walk, my company was promoting it and orange is a company color. It matched our shirt exactly. It fit a little loose, but I also ordered a size I wasn't sure would fit since I have been losing weight. There is no control top to this and it's just a 1 inch stretch band.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 18 June 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"41","Pants","Leggings Depot","Pamela","Very comfortable. Nice B & W design.  Not to be worn in really cold or hot weather.  Perfect for all other days - where as dressy, for pilates or yoga, like that.  Great quality and yes, they are buttery soft!  Bought more for myself and as gifts.  Everyone LOVED them - fat, skinny, short or long wasted.  Price is right, size was right for everyone i chose.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 7 February 2024","4.4 out of 5 stars"

Very similar in feel to a popular social sales brand and with some very nice print options.  Got loads of complements on these and my friends say they look like they could be from a pricier name brand.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 February 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars"
"44","Pants","Leggings Depot","Rissa907","I'm 5' 8"" and weigh 170lbs. I bought the plus size bc of my long legs.  Best decision ever. These are the best, most comfortable pair of leggings I have owned. I will be buying more. My 4 year old can't stop touching them because they are sooo soft.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 24 April 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I usually get TC leggings from lalaroe and these fit the same.  I love the elephant print","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 3 January 2017","4.0 out of 5 stars"
"46","Pants","Leggings Depot","Amber","Ok, at rhe risk of being redundant I have to say how much I love these leggings!!! The diverse choice of colors and patterns combined with the texture and fit makes these great.  I have never bought LR leggings but do have several active wear brands.  These are prettier and softer.  I am not a young woman so I was a little hesitant in wearing these outdoors.  That being said, as long as you wear a long enough top to cover your rear end I think it's totally doable.  I am retired and lead an a tive, casual life.  So many compliments have come my way!! I get the small size being 5'4 and 136 lbs.  Have already recommended Legging Depot to several women.  I am always checking to see if new paaterns are being released.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 4 September 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"49","Pants","Leggings Depot","CL Astley","I originally bought a couple leggings to go with a couple Tunic Tops. Not only did they look nice, but they feel so soft!For us ladies with a bit more curves, these leggings also make your butt & thighs look & feel more toned. I splurged for my b-day and bought different color designs to go with more tunic tops, also comfortable to wear to bed, and my husband loves them on meüíï","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 15 April 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars"
