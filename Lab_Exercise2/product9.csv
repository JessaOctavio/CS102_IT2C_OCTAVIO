"2","Water Bottle","LifeStraw Go Stainless Steel Water Filter Bottle with 2-Stage Integrated Filter Straw, Double Wall Vacuum Insulated, for Hiking, Backpacking, and Travel, 24oz, White","Craft Or Burn","I purchased both as used like new. The first one was clearly used multiple times. It had 2 dents, scratches, and once opened it had some water, wet filter, and a hair on the filter. The second one came in the original box and looked like it was just in storage or the warehouse for a long time. It had a different mouthpiece and filter. Below is what LifeStraw stated about the difference.Both filter are okay to continue use. The reason as to why they are slightly different is because the filter went through a redesign not long ago. The lettering or slight changes may be due to change in machinery at the factory or slight changes as we continue to try and make the product better.The change in mouthpiece may have to do with availability of the part. Our manager's bottle, same as yours has a clear mouthpiece and it came out of a box three weeks ago. I hope this helps clear any doubts you may have had.Overall I now feel the second was a good choice.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 4 March 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars"

While it can dribble when opened occasionally and it’s a bit tough to suck the water out, it does the job well when it comes to making the water taste fine.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 15 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Water always tastes amazing coming from here and it stays soooo cold. We took it to Africa and we’re always confident we’d be able to have clean water. The only thing is that it leaks if it’s on its side.

The silicone mouthpiece catches water under it, and the bend where the straw meets the bottle lid itself to fold leaks pretty badly between sips. I wouldn't lay this thing sideways after drinking from it. Durability is pretty decent.i dropped it from about 5 feet and it has a small dent but no paint damage, so it's not that noticeable.

"47","Water Bottle","LifeStraw Go Stainless Steel Water Filter Bottle with 2-Stage Integrated Filter Straw, Double Wall Vacuum Insulated, for Hiking, Backpacking, and Travel, 24oz, White","Charmin' Farmer","I have read up on the LifeStraw and even have a couple in the hiking gear, but I've never actually felt the necessity to test them out. We've been planning to hike the AT for a decade now since we've lived here our entire lives, but haven't quite gotten to where we can take the time off. Instead, we're piecemealing it together. I thought the bottles would be neat to have since I usually just use a simple Contigo.So far, I'm really happy with the choice. The bottle is double walled, although I think that's becoming commonplace. It's sturdy and I don't think dropping it accidentally down the hillside could hurt it beyond a few superficial scuffs. It breaks down fully, too so it's easier to clean it. I realize it's a filtered bottle, but sometimes mud and gunk find their way into your gear.The top comes off to fill the bottle and it has the type of mouth that is easy to open and close with one hand. It's a little thicker, but I don't have any issues with my teeth clunking it. I filled mine with mountain spring water in the Appalachia's, so it's probably close to drinkable already, however there's no way to know what is upstream. I filled it twice while we were out hiking and so far, I'm still standing. I make sure to sanitize my hands and keep my lid separate while filling because anything on the lid doesn't go through filtration. If you have concerns, it might be easier to capture water in a different spigot type bottle and pour into the filter if it's a dire circumstance. The water still tasted like mountain spring water to me, so I don't think it filtered out much as far as the minerals. It did make the city tap much more palatable and it didn't taste nearly as much like chlorine or hypochlorite.My spouse tried a bottle full, and he's still standing, too so five stars for that right off the bat. It's supposed to have two filters inside of it that have ultra or micro filtration to go through 1000 gallons of water with a secondary carbon filter that can go through 26 gallons. I haven't been keeping tabs on when to change it, but I'll probably get a notepad and just make notes so I can remember. It would take me a long time to go through 1000 gallons in my hiking gear and I feel like changing it sooner might be better just for construction. The carbon filter, I may need to change that bi-monthly and I plan to get a stock of those. Our city water tastes funky so I may even use this to just filter through some of the faucet water before we head out on trails.There is a packet in with the bottle to get it started, almost like a home water filtration system. Basically, you just need to clean the bottle and then activate the filter by running water through but be sure to read the process. The filters are super easy to take in and out, so when the time comes it isn't hard to change either of them out or both. I'm still a little leery about just how much it can do, but it's worth having on hand. The price is on the upper end, but it's for the convenience of a nice double walled bottle and additional filtration system.",NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 5 December 2020","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"48","Water Bottle","LifeStraw Go Stainless Steel Water Filter Bottle with 2-Stage Integrated Filter Straw, Double Wall Vacuum Insulated, for Hiking, Backpacking, and Travel, 24oz, White","Dawn2Dusk Adventures","When I saw this product available I was shock and also not surprised.  Ive own a few lifestraws, keeping them in my different packs for emergencies.  Ive only had to use it once and that's where the problem was.  It was always an emergency use item.  So to see the lifestraw become more practical was long over due.  I use it DAILY and I mean that with total sincerity.  My department has been under construction for the last 4 weeks.  We have to bring in our own water.  Because we don't have water fountain, bottles, or drinkable water, except for a sink.  So yep I pour sink water into my lifestraw bottle.  I also love the look on my coworkers face of shock.  I also use it when I hike or backpack.  Because I can trust it to work.  I carry a lot less water knowing there are places for me to top off on the trail.  Here are some good and bad things about it.PROS:The filtering mechanism is a lifestraw and it works perfectly.  It utilizes a membrane style filtration that catches 99.99% of just about everything out there.  You can poor pond water into it and get pure and clean drinkable water out.  The flow rate is good as long as your have a majority of the sediment strained out.  You will not stuggle to drink from the bottle.  The bottle is insulated, so if the water source is cold.  It will remain cold for awhile.  Its easy to clean, I just run it under a sink or dunk in a clean pot of water and swirl around.  Because the bottle is 700ml is size it will fit in most back pack pockets or day bags.  The large opening makes it easy to fill.  You can use the bottle without the lifestraw.  The filter pops off easily and add clean tap water to it.  The attached carabiner makes for easy transport and you can hook it anywhere.  I often just clip my bottle to my backpack when going to work.CONS:You can only filter water through the bottle.  This DOES NOT have the ability to filter inline, gravity, or from one bottle to another.  On longer trips I would have to topoff my lifestraw bottle 1st.  I would then store untreated water in other disposable containers.  I would then pour that untreated water into my lifestraw bottle to drinking.  This was definitely cumbersome and very impractical.Overall this bottle is a major improvement over having just the lifestraw filter.  It is best used as a part of a multi layer system for keeping clean water on you during expeditions or long excursions.  I use this bottle the most as a replacement to my other water bottles to ensure Im drinking clean water.",NA,"Reviewed in the United States on 14 December 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"49","Water Bottle","LifeStraw Go Stainless Steel Water Filter Bottle with 2-Stage Integrated Filter Straw, Double Wall Vacuum Insulated, for Hiking, Backpacking, and Travel, 24oz, White","Dawn2Dusk Adventures","If you think the LifeStraw is expensive, think again.  I’ve seen countless people buying expensive water at two buck a pop, only to toss the bottle afterwards.  They’re not only wasting money, but also the Earth’s resources, but I digress.  You get what you pay for and the LifeStraw is one of those little luxuries that’s worth investing in.One of the first things I noticed was the fact that it comes loaded with a filter.  No need to have to purchase one before starting.  This happened to me with an expensive water filter, upping the price considerably.  Whether I’m outside filtering water from a stream or a public water source, I want all the impurities out.  Think of the plastics people are ingesting when they purchase bottled water.I have a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) meter and tested the water prior to filling the LifeStraw.  I’m way into filtering any kind of water I ingest, including that I get at work.  The LifeStraw, which most people will purchase for camping purposes, filters out those unwanted parasites.  No one wants a case of the runs from Giardia or Cryptosporidium.  Cryto is something that can be avoided easily by using a water filter like the LifeStraw.Unlike the Camelbak, which has a bite valve, the LifeStraw takes a bit more effort to draw water through the straw.  No problem because it’s filtering what I’m drinking.  Now, there are two different filters in here:  the LifesStraw Membrane Microfilter and the LifeStraw Activated Carbon Filter.  Check out the specs on both of them.The LifeStraw Membrane Microfilter / LifeStraw Activated Carbon filter are one unit that can be purchased
