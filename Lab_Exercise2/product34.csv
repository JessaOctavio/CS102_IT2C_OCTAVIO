"3","Pants","heipeiwa Womens Winter Jeans Thick Skinny Pants Fleece Lined Slim Stretch Warm Jeggings","Maisy","It’s real denim with fleece lining. It’s definitely thicker than regular jeans but prefer the fleece to be thicker. Warm but could be warmer.It’s advertised as skinny fit but it’s slim fit in my opinion.Overall I’m satisfied with the product as it still keeps me warm in cold weather.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 22 August 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars"

"7","Pants","heipeiwa Womens Winter Jeans Thick Skinny Pants Fleece Lined Slim Stretch Warm Jeggings","Natalie Gedeon","These jeans are so thick they’re like cement. Hurts to bend your knees. They are not comfortable. I hate them. They have a short fly so it looks like I have a long V. So ugly.

"10","Pants","heipeiwa Womens Winter Jeans Thick Skinny Pants Fleece Lined Slim Stretch Warm Jeggings","Julie R","I love the thickness of the material and how warm it keeps my legs here in the Northwest area in the middle of winter. However, the size M was way to small I could not get my legs in. So I returned that one and went for the next size. I am petite, so the waiste line is perfect, my legs went in fine, but it’s too long and too much material on theLegs part of the pant. I keep Ed it anyway as I felt in love with the fact that it keeps me warm.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 17 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"12","Pants","heipeiwa Womens Winter Jeans Thick Skinny Pants Fleece Lined Slim Stretch Warm Jeggings","Natalie Gedeon","I wear a size 12-14 petite in most pants. I went by the reviews and I ordered a xxl. They fit baggy. They are a good two inches too long but with the taper of the pants and wearing boots they stay up. They are super warm. The lining is fleece and is attached to the stretch denim. I got black and it is super warm and super thick. I regular wash and dryer dried them a couple times and they came out as good as new. I’m looking forward to ordering more in different colours and I’m keeping the ones that are too big.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 23 June 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"13","Pants","heipeiwa Womens Winter Jeans Thick Skinny Pants Fleece Lined Slim Stretch Warm Jeggings","suprswimmer","It's the most comfy pair of pants I ever had. And keeps me nice and warm, and because it's not clinging onto my skin, the way leggings do, it's easy to add a thermal wear inside (or 2) when the temperature drops to -19 or has real feel temps of -26.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 15 November 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"14","Pants","heipeiwa Womens Winter Jeans Thick Skinny Pants Fleece Lined Slim Stretch Warm Jeggings","Jade smith","I LOVE these cozy warm slim stretchy leggings!!!  I feel like I searched hard for lined stretch leggings, and these are all I found.  They are affordable, yay!  My only wish is that there was more attention paid to the details like stitching, and zipper quality.  I am 5'7"", 106 pounds, and ordered the extra small.  I sometimes need a small, but these are plenty big.  They keep me as warm as jeans worn together with medium-weight long underwear.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 21 November 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I don’t buy  pants online because I need to try things on. I took a chance and bought them. They look so nice and I have gotten so many compliments on them. I’m all about warm and cozy so these pants are perfect for the person that’s likes to be warm. I’m 5,5 and 125lbs and the small fits the best. Will be ordering more.

"24","Pants","heipeiwa Womens Winter Jeans Thick Skinny Pants Fleece Lined Slim Stretch Warm Jeggings","Patty","The pants are awesome. It's nice to feel warm and cozy for a change, and they're good for cold winter days and even chilly autumn days.I am 5'5'' and got a small and it fits well.However, The rubber against my belly bugs me, and when I try to lower it to make it more comfortable, it create a bulge on the front side of the pants. It's hard to get used to not doing it, because high rise pants are so rare that they no longer feel comfortable. As a result I have to keep reminding myself not to adjust them throughout the day. But hey - I am warm, and they have deep pockets (+5 points). The sherpa is nice and thick, and it fits well.If I could ask for another version - it would have longer legs and shorter rise. Then it would be an ultimate go-to-without-thinking pants.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Unfortunately I fall between 2 sizes: small is a nice fir in the legs but the waist area is too tight. Medium is comfortable around the waist but the legs are more loose in the legs than I’d like.

"41","Pants","heipeiwa Womens Winter Jeans Thick Skinny Pants Fleece Lined Slim Stretch Warm Jeggings","Maisy","My husband and I love to travel in January or February- there are less people and most places are much cheaper since it’s off-season. The issue for me has always been my lower body. I can bundle up with a warm coat, scarf, beanie, and warm boots, but my jeans or leggings would always make my lower body freeze on a day out sightseeing. I’ve tried several kinds of long underwear but they always ride up and make me uncomfortable.Enter these jeans! They are very comfortable and stretchy, but most importantly- they are super warm! I’m also short, and I’m so glad they offer short sizes- they were the perfect length! I tested them out while looking at Christmas lights and they were awesome. I can now truly look forward to our Boston trip in January!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 22 August 2023","4.3 out of 5 stars"
