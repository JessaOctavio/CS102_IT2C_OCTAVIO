"8","Pants","Yehopere Women's Winter Fleece Lined Jeans Slim Fit Warm Skinny High Waist Denim Jean","Alena P","I'm always cold, so I finally started buying more fleece-lined clothes. These keep my legs warm and I am happy that I bought them. I would prefer a longer inseam though!-Sizing-I’m 5’3” and I bought ""Elasticwaist Blue88"" in medium when I was wearing about an eight in pants, but I couldn't get these on at all! The next winter I was down to a four or six - and these finally fit. Several reviewers said these ran large, but my experience is that the medium runs small.-Washing-These machine wash and dry easily, without any noticeable shrinking. Colorfast on the outside, fluffy warm on the inside. I wash these with my dark clothes.-Wearing-Thick fleece = bulky. The bulk isn’t unreasonable, but it is visible without a jacket. These pants are fairly stretchy, but my issue is the length. Walking is fine, but sitting gets uncomfortable because the pants are really tight on my kneecaps. So I pull these up to get more slack at the knees -which makes driving more comfortable- but then my ankles get cold because they've lost their cover. A longer inseam would be great. Until then I just need to be mindful about socks or boots to compensate for cold ankles at the expense of knee mobility.-Overall-Great buy! I can finally go outdoors in the winter and not freeze immediately. A longer inseam would be nice, but these are still worth buying if you’re always cold like me.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 22 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"12","Pants","Yehopere Women's Winter Fleece Lined Jeans Slim Fit Warm Skinny High Waist Denim Jean","SB","Ich habe mir die Hose für die tägliche Arbeit im Stall gekauft. -10 Grad sind kein Problem mit dieser Hose. Sie ist absolut angenehm zu tragen, sieht aus wie eine normale Jeans, fühlt sich auch so an. Innen angenehm weich, auch die hinteren Hosentaschen. Die vorderen Hosentaschen sind aus einfachem Futterstoff. Ich selbst habe sie mir eine Nummer kleiner gekauft weil ich meine Hosen lieber eng anliegend mag. Sie passt sich gut dem Bein an.Von der Qualität bin ich auch absolut begeistert. Wo normale Jeans durchs Reiten schnell reißen, sieht man bei dieser nichts. Die Farbe sieht selbst nach 20x waschen noch wie neu aus, auch das Futter innen ist mach wie vor fluffig und weich.Meine Kollegin hat sich auch direkt eine bestellt.

"19","Pants","Yehopere Women's Winter Fleece Lined Jeans Slim Fit Warm Skinny High Waist Denim Jean","J. C. B.","I purchased the large size. I was pleasantly surprised that these fit me like most of my size 8 jeans fit me. The inseam is plenty long. I have not washed them yet. If they shrink a bit that would actually be good. They have a bit of extra room, not tight at all, and easy to pull on. I have wide calves, and a bit of pudge at the waist. Because  of the fleece lining, they make me look a bit like I gained five pounds, and like I'm wearing an incontinence pad, ha ha!  If they were a bit tighter, I think they would look a bit better that way. Anyway I don't care, because it's cold outside. Getting into a cold car, or going out shopping without me whining about having cold legs is why I bought these. They are teddy-bear soft inside! They are lightly warm! They come up to my waist. The denim feels like real denim! I like the light blue color that I chose. I like the elastic waist with belt loops. (I usually wear a shirt or sweater over my jeans.) I think I want to order another pair of these jeans.UPDATE 1/31/22I liked these enough that I purchased a black pair with zipper fly, in medium size this time.The fit is more flattering than the large elastic waist ones I had previously purchased in light blue.I love the way they look and fit, but the chemical smell hasn't gone away after two washings. I think it must be something in the black dye; it's almost a sulfur smell. I hope after a couple more launderings that will go away.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 8 January 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"39","Pants","Yehopere Women's Winter Fleece Lined Jeans Slim Fit Warm Skinny High Waist Denim Jean","Kimberlie Carrell","So comfortable I don't want to switch to my pj's at night, bc my pj's aren't as comfortable or as cozy. I'm a solid size 14. When these arrived they looked too small. I thought there was a mistake, but when I tried them on they looked like really great (flattering) skinny jeans. They stretch with you, so they are great for everything, and they look like pricier jeans than they are. I get cold easily, so I added these to my collection of fleece lined pants. I like them more than my Eddie Bauer ones. Pretty much living in these until the weather warms. If you live somewhere cold or are going to be sitting somewhere that gets ""cool"" outside at night like bleachers, add a pair of these to your wardrobe. P.S. - They support everything you want supported without looking like you are trying to do that.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 9 January 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"
