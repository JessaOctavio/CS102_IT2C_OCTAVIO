"3","Makeup","Wet n Wild Always Naked Palette Always Nude 1114216","Recomendable","Love this palette, the value is unmatched. The quality is great, shadows are varied colors but too many shimmery sparkle colors for my liking. Not disappointed just wish there were move palettes to choose from especially ones without sparkles and shimmers.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 7 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"7","Makeup","Wet n Wild Always Naked Palette Always Nude 1114216","Nur f.","I was shocked at the price I got it for on Amazon (under $10). I was expecting to return it, but it’s actually amazing! I use these along side my $100+ shadow palettes and they blend just as easy. The shimmers are decent but the mattes are AWESOME. Sooo worth it, especially if you love the soft brown natural look. I recommend for fair to medium skin tones. May look ashy on darker tones unfortunately.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 24 February 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars"

The price was good. But as soon as I saw the makeup dust in the corner of the unopened bubble wrap I knew that like so many others, the eyeshadow came broken. I should have listened to the reviews. There is a fine dusting of dark shadow on all of the colors and inside the unsealed container. Worth the price? Not really. You expect better than this. The seller should be honest and tell you the goods already are or will likely arrive in poor condition. The colors looked very nice in the ad and I preferred this palette over the matte.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 31 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"15","Makeup","Wet n Wild Always Naked Palette Always Nude 1114216","A. Boyd","First off, the first one I ordered arrived shattered.  About half of the shadows were completely gone.  I told Amazon and I was sent a new one immediately without charge.  The second arrived well packaged and completely safe.  If it arrives broken, just tell them.That being said, this is an AWESOME palette.  My main gripe with most 'neutral' palettes is that they are not actually neutral.  They are usually more warm toned and not true taupe type shades.  This is NOT  that palette.  Every shade has that true neutral undertone making it go great with everything.  The pigments are long lasting and blend like a high end palette.  There is some fall out, but I get the same fall out in ND palettes, so it definitely is not a deal breaker.  I have some expensive palettes and this is at the top of my list of daily wear.  I still reach for the others, but only to add pops of color if I want it with this palette as my base colors.  The best part is it is so affordable that I can repurchase it when I hit pan on one or two colors without feeling like I just wasted so much money or....hunting down ten different individual shades to find one JUST like my favorite in a palette that is way too expensive to repurchase just for one color.  I feel like I hit gold with this one.  Oh, and Tati brought me to it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 14 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

You don’t need a lot on your brush, a little goes a long way. My only complaint is that it can be a little messy to apply. The shadow flakes onto the rest of your face when applying.

The pigment is good and I can create beautiful eye looksThe down side is the amount of fall or dust when dipping in the pans. Be careful to tail your brushes to avoid fall on your face when usingThis is a $6 pallet so overall I would say it’s a great product for the price.
