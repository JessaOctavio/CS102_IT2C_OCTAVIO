"1","Bags","FashionPuzzle Triple Zip Small Crossbody Bag","ellbee2014","I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this bag. I have a pet hate of bad zippers, so I was over the moon about this bag’s lovely and smooth zippers. This bag is beautiful on the inside too, with a black-and-white striped interior which makes it really easy to see your things inside. I just love this little bag!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 14 September 2023","4.6 out of 5 stars"

"11","Bags","FashionPuzzle Triple Zip Small Crossbody Bag","Rachel","In the flurry of everyday life where style meets function, I have found a perfect companion in the form of the FashionPuzzle Triple Zip Small Crossbody Bag. With its contemporary design, desirable quality, and outstanding utility, this bag transcends ordinary expectations, making it an absolute must-have for anyone on the go.From the first moment you lay your eyes on this bag, you will surely be captivated by its modern yet timeless design. Its aesthetic is in sync with current trends, and it scores full points in the style department. Available in several fashionable hues, it's never a task to match this bag with your preferred attire. Moreover, the faux leather gives it a polished and high-end look, feel, and durability that easily withstands daily wear and tear.Undoubtedly, my favorite feature is the tri-zip compartment design. The innovative layout allows quick accessibility while ensuring safety for your belongings. This bag has sufficient room to hold all your essentials neatly organized- be it a wallet, smartphone, makeup, or keys. It's the perfect blend of style and practicality.The adjustable strap is a boon, providing versatility in how the bag is worn. The stress on personalization and ease of use is clearly evident, as it can be slung comfortably across your body, freeing your hands and making it an ideal choice for shopping trips, daily commutes, or traveling.Every detail is beautifully thought out, right down to the zippers. They glide smoothly, ensuring you're never fumbling or struggling to fetch things out of your bag in a hurry. The metal accents provide a chic sophistication that elevates the overall style quotient of the bag.The FashionPuzzle Triple Zip Small Crossbody Bag checks all the boxes - comfort, aesthetic appeal, and functionality. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a compact bag that does not compromise on style or practicality.

"13","Bags","FashionPuzzle Triple Zip Small Crossbody Bag","Lila","Love this bag. I bought this purse to use at work. I’m a direct support professional and I needed a smaller bag to transport my clients meds and debit/food stamp cards and this is perfect. I love that it has 3 separate areas with zippers to keep everything organized. This purse will be so much better to carry around than my big heavy purse.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 September 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"14","Bags","FashionPuzzle Triple Zip Small Crossbody Bag","Patricia Heather Buckles","I walk with either a cane or a rollater.  I have been using a book bag for3 years and it does get in the way - always slipping down one arm or the other; and it’s very inconvenient to get into. I was so glad to find this purse!  Since it’s a crossbody there’s no issue with it slipping down my arms, and it holds everything I need to have with me at all times.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 23 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"33","Bags","FashionPuzzle Triple Zip Small Crossbody Bag","INFPmadness","Update: I have been using this for about a week steady because I needed a neutral color bag again and I have to say, although I still don't love the color, I love the size & features. I am now ordering it in the dark gray because I really do like everything else except the color...I bought it thinking it would be a nice, neutral crossbody for a wedding. The material/quality was just ok, but not great. If I had had time I would have returned it for something else as I just didn't love it, but I didn't (have time) so I kept it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 15 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"36","Bags","FashionPuzzle Triple Zip Small Crossbody Bag","Hello","I was expecting a PU leather black bag but instead got a suede-y dark grey bag even though the label on the bag says ""black"". I decided to keep it because it still goes with everything.  It's a great medium sized crossbody bag for someone who doesn't carry that many things around on a daily, just essentials. Overall a great bag, just disappointed with the colour. \_*_*_/","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 30 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The fact that I continued to carry it after the trip is a testament to its functionality and style. I hope it continues to be a reliable and stylish companion for everyday use.

"43","Bags","FashionPuzzle Triple Zip Small Crossbody Bag","H","I was looking for a spring/summer bag that was slightly bigger than my belt bag but still plain and simple. It’s perfect! I love the color and the material. It’s very roomy inside but very light to carry around. I love how the zipper is gold since I don’t wear silver. It matches all of my outfits. Hopefully it will last awhile because I plan to use this everyday.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 11 March 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars"

However, it carried my lotion, my stuffed wallet, a mini bag with my makeup, a small bottle of Excedrin and more! Considering getting a black one now for an evening bag. I got the purple one, which I absolutely adored. It came out for St. Patrick’s Day and held everything I needed. You cannot go wrong with this purse.

I thought for the price, even though not real leather, it would at least look like leather, not plastic.  Went to Marshall's, for an extra $10 got a very similar purse that's Italian leather.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Canada on 25 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
