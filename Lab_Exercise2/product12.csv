The design is nice, the keyboard feels nice (trackpad takes some getting used to clicking), there are enough ports for the peripherals I use, and it's run older games for 5 hours straight with negligible heat. I haven't tested the webcam and microphone yet.I don't play new or graphic-intensive games, but this ran very well on older games (Team Fortress 2, Spec Ops: The Line, Magic the Gathering 2014) and some newer ones (Deep Rock Galactic). I plan to run Halo Infinite and Outer Wilds later this week and expect it to perform well.I will keep this updated as my time with this computer progresses. 5/5___________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW (20 March 2022):TL;DR - I'm sure the laptop is great but the one I received is defective (can't charge - motherboard issue). I am returning it to Amazon and have ordered another one, as I'm sure a functioning unit will meet my expectations for this product. I will update my review when my second order arrives. As for now, 1 star for defective product.I wanted a budget gaming laptop to replace my retired ASUS G55VW (2011). I chose this model due to its strong specs for a budget device, including an RTX 3050Ti (midrange for graphics cards in 2021 but supports the burgeoning ray-tracing technology used in current games), Core i7 CPU, 1 TB SSD storage, and 16GB memory. I also chose this because I wanted a 17-inch screen. The price point maxed out my acceptable budget range (~$1200).I believe this laptop is a good choice for me considering these specs and the price, and I look forward to trying it out.HOWEVER, the model I received appears to be defective - I believe I got a lemon. Upon unboxing, plugging the charger into the laptop did not illuminate the 'charging' light on the laptop, even after trying different electrical outlets and surge protectors. I took it to a local computer repair shop and the tech confirmed the charger itself was functional, as his voltmeter reported 19+ V. Upon opening the device and testing it, he concluded that something was wrong with the motherboard that prevented charging (I am unfamiliar with computers and cannot relay the significance of what he said).I filed for a return-and-replace with Amazon; they accepted the return but denied the replacement - likely so I couldn't keep both laptops and run. The laptop is currently repackaged and I will drop it off at UPS for a return in the next couple of days.I immediately ordered another unit, as this model was my first choice. I expect the second product to work just fine and meet my purchasing expectations, and eagerly await its arrival. I understand defective products are produced and shipped as a natural part of the production process, and do not consider this representative of Acer.While I'm sure the product will meet my expectations, I am saddened to receive a defective model. I will provide an updated review when my second order arrives.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022","4.4 out of 5 stars"

Bought this to replace a near-10 year old computer I had which was on it's last legs. I knew I wanted a computer which was capable of playing high-graphics games at a decent fps, and this computer delivers.Great graphics quality, very good processing speed, good sound quality, good storage. My only issue, and this is pretty minor, is that the cooling fans are a bit loud. But they definitely are doing their job, and I so far haven't had any issues with my computer feeling too hot.8/10 purchase. Only wish the fans were a bit quieter, and the storage was a bit bigger. Otherwise, an excellent computer.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I enjoy the red light up keyboard. Generally, the performance is outstanding, but I would say that the dual fans drain the battery rather quickly, and I cannot get the same amount of work done before the battery dies on this particular laptop compared to others, which only have a single fan. Outside of that blemish I think it’s absolutely fantastic and I am very happy with the purchase.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I do many things with my computer that a desktop would not work for me, as I have to move it around frequently and like portability, so I explored into the gaming laptop world. This was a cheaper, yet good option for an entry level Device.Processor- I bought the i7-11800H model and this processor seems to be a bit overkill for even some higher end games. But it’s great to have that extra power to multitask as well. I have not had any issues with the processing power. It’s fast and smooth.Graphics- I’m using the RTX-3050Ti and I’ve seen the card likes to run at 100% nearly all the time when in a game but I have had no issues with its capability of running smoothly and not overheating, and I haven’t even tried any undervolting yet which could improve it more.RAM- the 16gb ram and 4gb vram work well together. I use the heavily graphic related game of BeamNG Drive that requires a lot of RAM to run smooth and have tried several multiplayer games and have never seen the RAM get over 70% (which is pretty good for heavily demanding games). This was Plenty of RAM for the gaming I do to keep it running smooth.Overall- this is a great starting laptop for anyone looking for a gaming laptop or something fast for multitasking. Sure there might be a couple other options with similar price ranges that might perform slightly better. But this one was the lowest price I saw for what you get out of it and it’s been working just fine for me. I haven’t had it long so I may be back to update this if my opinion changes lol. But first impressions were really good.Negatives- the graphics card works really great as mentioned above, but if you use it running at 100% for a couple hours you can completely notice a performance drop because the temperature starts to get too hot. I haven’t had it overheat but I have had some slight performance differences after a while of hard use. That’s really the only “issue”, that’s not a huge deal, that I’ve had. And it’s correctable by changing up some deeper settings.As I have mentioned, this is a great ENTRY Level laptop. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone that is heavily into gaming. It works great for what I want to do with it but it would work pretty bad for a professional gamer (not that pros would ever use a laptop for gaming lol). I am also newer to PC gaming but I’m pretty savvy with computers. So being able to change some settings that the average newer user wouldn’t know how to, without YouTube tutorials, have made this laptop perform a little better than out of the box. But these changes I made so far are all settings included on the computer, not third party software included in this review (meaning anyone can change the basic settings to improve the performance slightly as I have).PS- I thought I had a dead laptop when it came like other reviewers complained about. I read the review of one person that said you have to jam the power plug in there really good til it clicks for it to work. I initially thought I pushed hard enough and heard a light snapping sound, but it wouldn’t charge or turn on. So I pushed a lot harder and heard it click a lot louder and it started charging perfectly fine and started up right away.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The build quality of the laptop itself was very impressive, very rugged and durable, and the hinges seem like they would last at least 6-7 years.I found that you could lower the fan sound a little by setting the Power profile of your computer to Balanced, and helping it even further along by setting the display to 60 Hz, but it might require you to use Vertical Sync/VSYNC in some games.  I was able to run Starfield at 100+ FPS on Low, but the fans were blaring at me the entire time. The fact that it also comes with SATA drive support is also very impressive, because most laptops have completely abandoned SATA support for NVME to save space and for slightly better thermal performance. This computer also has 2 fans for improved thermals (weird fact, I know, but some laptops only have 1), but they also generate twice the noise.Aside from that, this is a very solid entry-level gaming laptop and will be able to run modern games at low-medium settings for at least a few years.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It had a defective screen. I sent it to Acer. It took them two days to get my a shipping label. It took seven days for it to reach them. After they had it for a week, they could not give me an ETA on when repairs would be finished. I finally got it back today, on the 25th, and immediately returned it to Amazon because I had to have a functional computer and couldn't hold onto my loaner without a solid estimate for when I'd get this one back.So it was nearly a full four weeks from when I originally got it that it was in my hands in a fully working state, and from what I've seen, this is fast for Acer.Which is a shame - this is a lot of computer for the price. To give credit where it's due, I tested the laptop when it was returned to me and it seemed like the screen problems I was having were completely fixed.Considering the price puts this solidly in the mid-range category, you're getting a lot for what you're paying. It doesn't need an additional harddrive or RAM to be completely viable out of the box. (I bought the 1TB/16GB RAM model.) If you want to add a harddrive, there's a SATA cable in the box, and it's fairly easy to get the back panel off. There's even a tutorial by Acer on YouTube on exactly how to do it.In terms of right-to-repair, though, it's mediocre. It's easy to get to the guts of the computer itself. I'd like having easy access panels for the HDD and RAM, but that's a minor complaint - it's not hard to pry this laptop open.What's disappointing is the mount for the screen. Screens die faster than anything else on a laptop. The way this thing is built, I'm not surprised my screen was defective out of the box. You'll want to always open and close the lid with both hands if you want your screen to last the lifetime of the laptop. If you ever need to change the screen out, it's clearly not designed for you to be able to do so. The bezels aren't as simple to pop open as they are on other units, and the screen is held in place by glue, making it so that you probably want to take it to a technician unless you have some experience doing these kinds of repairs yourself.I wish I could say my experience with this was stellar. I loved my Acer Predator Helios from 2018. I've loved the Aspire I've used for writing documents. I'm just completely unimpressed by Acer's service. Three weeks in and no ETA concerning when the laptop would be back in my hands was unacceptable. They only send you updates when they receive your laptop and when they're sending it back. You can't find out any further details - not even where you're at in the queue.I ended up getting a Lenovo Idea Pad 3 Gaming and so far I am loving it. I can't rate Lenovo's support because I haven't had to contact them. The machine I am using now feels rock solid; much better than I would have expected given the amount of power it has for the price. (Under $800.)With this laptop - it looks like it would be worth it if you get it and it works as intended right out of the box. But - I'm far from the only person who has had an issue with it. They've had build quality problems with the Nitro line all the way through, and there are cases where it took 5-6 weeks for people to get their machines back if they went through Acer's support.With these specs, from the testing I did when I had it hooked up to an external monitor, it performs as beautifully as you'd expect. There is a rock solid machine here if you're careful with the screen and get one that works right out of the box.If you don't?Don't deal with Acer support. Buy a third party warranty if you think you'll ever need it. Buying online, I'd go for something without a lot of reported build problems. This is the kind of laptop that I would buy in person so I could test and immediately replace a defective unit.My trust in Acer is completely shot after this experience. At this point, I'm just glad they got it back to me within the return window. I jumped in because I've had amazing experiences with Acer hardware in the past. Those will probably be my last Acer machines. It's completely unacceptable for a multi-million dollar company to mass produce a line of laptops with a high number of defects and a support process that leaves the buyer in the dark for the majority of it.So - based on build quality, it's a 3 1/2 to 4 star laptop if it works. If it doesn't? You're better off returning it and getting another computer.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

So I had to give it up. in  Facebook group I saw this laptop recommended as a good value for a gaming laptop. I decided to treat myself. I love it! I love how the keyboard lights up, I love how it boots up quickly, the great response in gameplay. The only thing that I do not like about it is the battery life is like 3 hours. I called the acer help desk to see is this is a problem. I was told that this is normal. This is not a problem for me because I do not travel and can plug it in when I need the battery recharged. This might be a problem for other folks.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

It's brand new and the screen moves when I type, very annoying...Update: so the noise seems to be coil whine from what others have told me and it does run hot but only if you're maxing the games out, nothing a cooling pad can't fix. The wobble is annoying but I've heard it's normal, I think it's luck of the draw for that.My question is could I possibly tighten the hinge?

If you're considering this laptop my guess is you're like me in that you dont want to build a pc yourself for whatever reason. I would say this was a fair purchase but if you can wait, i'd say save up a bit more and get a pc built for yourself at microcenter or something. I have played many games and all of them can be played on at least medium settings with no lag. That would include cyberpunk 2077 to give you an idea. I really only have one problem with the laptop and it makes it a bad long term investment. From fully charged, i can only game for maybe 50 minutes. Cant even reach an hour. If that sounds unpleasant to you then pass on this. Otherwise it serves its purpose for me in playing all the games I couldn't on my previous laptop.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022","4.4 out of 5 stars"

However, after a few months with it I'm happy. I don't game much but I've played a few easy going games and have had no actual issues, and will be upgrading to 32GB of RAM just because. My biggest issue is that if you stay on a bright screen for a while, like Amazon for example, and then go to a website where you're using a dark mode, like I do on Discord, the ghost image can be seen. Also, when streaming shows/movies there's always a bright spot in the bottom left corner as if someone is home and forgot to turn the light off in a room.

Acer Nitro had done great in the past for me. The excellent lifetime given by my previous Nitro 5, i5 Gtx1060  from 2018. Brought me back with established brand confidence.Then it hurt my feelings with deceptive system write ups, misleading access port specs, ect...The short version.This is a whole lot of all the right components forced to live with each other against their will. This laptop is an uncooperative disappointment.All the gripes:I picked this model specifically for its Thunderbolt 4 USB C Display Adapter Port and was thrilled about the RTX3060 GPU.It took 20 hours of setup (WTF seriously) to find out that besides all the issues that would have made it a defective return anyhow, the Display Port is hard wired to the Intel HD on-board graphics processor. It is built to fail on that point.This system has issues built into it in ways that boggle your bogs. The screen had 7 to 8 light discoloration areas around the edges like it had been beaten on from the inside. The new power cord design is something I hope they have fixed in 2023. My experience was it caused power failures when moved while plugged in.  Sudden total power failures, it was like to a blackout.Speaking of feedback, the audio on board sends back slight popping sounds.  Digital distortions from all operations and outputs was intermittent; it does seem consistent as reported by other owners of this model. Some speculation whether this is a new WinOS build issue.If you are a VR user just looking to occasionally link to a laptop, find another. It is possible but the performance of the  RTX3060 in this systems build is surprisingly dismal. At midrange settings, no ray tracing, CP2077 (Cyberpunk 2077) was not able to hold 15 FPS for any interaction beyond the menu screen. The RTX GPU and the CPU share a studio apt with inadequate airflow. It heats up fast and ""The GPU Little Dual Fans that Could"" can't . Why they even let this build go into manufacture is beyond me. This machine cannot keep baseline operating temperature while watching a Movie. This is actually the first time in 13 years of having a laptop as a critical tool of my trade that I even noticed they had any fans. I always just gave them proper ventilation. You will notice these fans thiugh, when the 95 to 110 degree air starts blasting from all possible routes. This is the GPU warning you that an "" Emergency Safety Shutdown"" is about to occur because you are playing Fortnite or whatever. This was the only helpful unintended feature. I found I had about 15 to 20 seconds to save my game or work. By the time I figured out that workflow hack, I finally admitted to myself that I had been naive and was being stubborn trying to create work arounds and validate the value of my purchase.If you are the kind of person who enjoys taking badly designed hardware platforms and tinkering with them you found a deal here..Cyberware PC, ASUS, NITRO have done well by me for the 3 previous workstations I have built on their bare bones. My 2018 Nitro 5 survived, falls, collisions and was even stepped on (In my bag) and made a cracking noise that brought so many simultaneous gasps in a room full of technicians that you could feel the air leaving the room.So please don't let this lengthy review of this one product turn you away from the brand. It has been solid so far.Goodbye 2018 Nitro 5 you were a adequate tool and a  nobel machine.R.I.P.  ""MiniPrime""2018-2023 Death by Winter Storm  😭 Like tears in Rain,,I found it next an open window after a storm, in a puddle.Waaaah!If you read this whole thing, thanks I guess.

I use 3D modeling and game engine programs like Unity, 3DsMax, Blender, Photoshop, and Unreal. I also play plenty of MMORGs and Steam games in my (very little) free-time. And I really needed a new work/personal gaming laptop as my last Acer Predator was starting to degrade after several years of constant use. So I decided to try the Nitro since I really liked the Predator and have an Acer monitor as well.So here's my thoughts:DISPLAYThis is something very important to me being an artist. And the colors are accurate and vivid. I don't have any issue editing my art as I switch displays. It can also get quite bright, nothing too eye burning (I keep it on the lower side) and the screen itself is quite large, and visible even from 2 feet away on a desk.PROCESSOR SPEED / RAM / GPUUsing Unity and Unreal, this laptop has been able to handle my beefy VFX work without issue. Same with my of my 3D Modeling and 3D Sculpting work which can be quite demanding on the GPU. Although the RAM is on the low-medium side so I will be looking into getting an additional one so things run a little faster.STORAGEI upgraded on hard-drive storage when it came to this laptop and I'm so glad I have. All those programs I listed above + PC games can take up a lot of space and I have not had an issue needing to delete something in order to do something else.HARDWARE DESIGNIts nice, sleek, and simple. Very similar to the 2018 Predator I have. The keyboard does light up, which I always like but you can not program custom colors (which is no issue for me but good to know). The only other thing is that this is a LARGE laptop. It is larger than my last one and I really like it being this size for the display. It luckily does fit in my laptop bag but I would make sure to measure yours to make sure this will work for you.PRICEBuying a laptop will always be an expense, especially a gaming laptop. But for the storage space, display quality, and RAM, this laptop is a great deal for $1,200.FINAL THOUGHTSIts been 2 months since Ive been using this laptop and I have had a great experience. Gamer or Artist, I would definitely recommend.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars"

However the laptop is not CRU compliment or customer replacement unit parts. To access the spot to add an extra SSD or RAM the ENTIRE back must be removed. And to add an extra SSD requires using the supplied ribbon, however my black ribbon lock fell into the computer so I can't add an extra SSD.A tip, if you want the red keyboard backlight to remain on while in use the setting is in the BIOS.Overall the performance of the laptop for the cost is very much worth buying. So yes I recommend it. However if you intend to add an extra SSD or RAM, better have someone with lots of experience and tiny fingers.

Bird","I bought this laptop for my son's 16th birthday. It arrived and my son opened it. He was so excited and then the laptop wouldn't turn on. We thought maybe it needs to be plugged in and charge for a bit. He plugged it in, the charging light came on and it still wouldn't turn on. No sound, no lights, nothing. We waited another couple hours, the orange charging light turned to blue and we tried again.....still nothing. Brand new, straight out of the box and it wouldn't work. I had to then contact customer support and I had to mail this brand new computer to Texas for a technician to work on. Now we have to wait for them to look at it and figure out what is wrong with it and ship it back. So, my experience so far is not great.Update - Finally received the computer back from the technician. It took about 4 days to get there, 3 days for them to fix it, and then 4 to send it back. This was quicker than I expected. There was a cable that wasn't connected right inside, which they fixed. The computer is fast and my son has enjoyed it the last day he has had it. So far, it is a decent computer but who knows what will happen as time goes on. I am giving 3 stars for the aggravation of it not working when we first got it.

The design is nice, the keyboard feels nice (trackpad takes some getting used to clicking), there are enough ports for the peripherals I use, and it's run older games for 5 hours straight with negligible heat. I haven't tested the webcam and microphone yet.I don't play new or graphic-intensive games, but this ran very well on older games (Team Fortress 2, Spec Ops: The Line, Magic the Gathering 2014) and some newer ones (Deep Rock Galactic). I plan to run Halo Infinite and Outer Wilds later this week and expect it to perform well.I will keep this updated as my time with this computer progresses. 5/5___________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW (20 March 2022):TL;DR - I'm sure the laptop is great but the one I received is defective (can't charge - motherboard issue). I am returning it to Amazon and have ordered another one, as I'm sure a functioning unit will meet my expectations for this product. I will update my review when my second order arrives. As for now, 1 star for defective product.I wanted a budget gaming laptop to replace my retired ASUS G55VW (2011). I chose this model due to its strong specs for a budget device, including an RTX 3050Ti (midrange for graphics cards in 2021 but supports the burgeoning ray-tracing technology used in current games), Core i7 CPU, 1 TB SSD storage, and 16GB memory. I also chose this because I wanted a 17-inch screen. The price point maxed out my acceptable budget range (~$1200).I believe this laptop is a good choice for me considering these specs and the price, and I look forward to trying it out.HOWEVER, the model I received appears to be defective - I believe I got a lemon. Upon unboxing, plugging the charger into the laptop did not illuminate the 'charging' light on the laptop, even after trying different electrical outlets and surge protectors. I took it to a local computer repair shop and the tech confirmed the charger itself was functional, as his voltmeter reported 19+ V. Upon opening the device and testing it, he concluded that something was wrong with the motherboard that prevented charging (I am unfamiliar with computers and cannot relay the significance of what he said).I filed for a return-and-replace with Amazon; they accepted the return but denied the replacement - likely so I couldn't keep both laptops and run. The laptop is currently repackaged and I will drop it off at UPS for a return in the next couple of days.I immediately ordered another unit, as this model was my first choice. I expect the second product to work just fine and meet my purchasing expectations, and eagerly await its arrival. I understand defective products are produced and shipped as a natural part of the production process, and do not consider this representative of Acer.While I'm sure the product will meet my expectations, I am saddened to receive a defective model. I will provide an updated review when my second order arrives.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022","4.4 out of 5 stars"

I enjoy the red light up keyboard. Generally, the performance is outstanding, but I would say that the dual fans drain the battery rather quickly, and I cannot get the same amount of work done before the battery dies on this particular laptop compared to others, which only have a single fan. Outside of that blemish I think it’s absolutely fantastic and I am very happy with the purchase.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars"

I do many things with my computer that a desktop would not work for me, as I have to move it around frequently and like portability, so I explored into the gaming laptop world. This was a cheaper, yet good option for an entry level Device.Processor- I bought the i7-11800H model and this processor seems to be a bit overkill for even some higher end games. But it’s great to have that extra power to multitask as well. I have not had any issues with the processing power. It’s fast and smooth.Graphics- I’m using the RTX-3050Ti and I’ve seen the card likes to run at 100% nearly all the time when in a game but I have had no issues with its capability of running smoothly and not overheating, and I haven’t even tried any undervolting yet which could improve it more.RAM- the 16gb ram and 4gb vram work well together. I use the heavily graphic related game of BeamNG Drive that requires a lot of RAM to run smooth and have tried several multiplayer games and have never seen the RAM get over 70% (which is pretty good for heavily demanding games). This was Plenty of RAM for the gaming I do to keep it running smooth.Overall- this is a great starting laptop for anyone looking for a gaming laptop or something fast for multitasking. Sure there might be a couple other options with similar price ranges that might perform slightly better. But this one was the lowest price I saw for what you get out of it and it’s been working just fine for me. I haven’t had it long so I may be back to update this if my opinion changes lol. But first impressions were really good.Negatives- the graphics card works really great as mentioned above, but if you use it running at 100% for a couple hours you can completely notice a performance drop because the temperature starts to get too hot. I haven’t had it overheat but I have had some slight performance differences after a while of hard use. That’s really the only “issue”, that’s not a huge deal, that I’ve had. And it’s correctable by changing up some deeper settings.As I have mentioned, this is a great ENTRY Level laptop. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone that is heavily into gaming. It works great for what I want to do with it but it would work pretty bad for a professional gamer (not that pros would ever use a laptop for gaming lol). I am also newer to PC gaming but I’m pretty savvy with computers. So being able to change some settings that the average newer user wouldn’t know how to, without YouTube tutorials, have made this laptop perform a little better than out of the box. But these changes I made so far are all settings included on the computer, not third party software included in this review (meaning anyone can change the basic settings to improve the performance slightly as I have).PS- I thought I had a dead laptop when it came like other reviewers complained about. I read the review of one person that said you have to jam the power plug in there really good til it clicks for it to work. I initially thought I pushed hard enough and heard a light snapping sound, but it wouldn’t charge or turn on. So I pushed a lot harder and heard it click a lot louder and it started charging perfectly fine and started up right away.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The build quality of the laptop itself was very impressive, very rugged and durable, and the hinges seem like they would last at least 6-7 years.I found that you could lower the fan sound a little by setting the Power profile of your computer to Balanced, and helping it even further along by setting the display to 60 Hz, but it might require you to use Vertical Sync/VSYNC in some games.  I was able to run Starfield at 100+ FPS on Low, but the fans were blaring at me the entire time. The fact that it also comes with SATA drive support is also very impressive, because most laptops have completely abandoned SATA support for NVME to save space and for slightly better thermal performance. This computer also has 2 fans for improved thermals (weird fact, I know, but some laptops only have 1), but they also generate twice the noise.Aside from that, this is a very solid entry-level gaming laptop and will be able to run modern games at low-medium settings for at least a few years.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It had a defective screen. I sent it to Acer. It took them two days to get my a shipping label. It took seven days for it to reach them. After they had it for a week, they could not give me an ETA on when repairs would be finished. I finally got it back today, on the 25th, and immediately returned it to Amazon because I had to have a functional computer and couldn't hold onto my loaner without a solid estimate for when I'd get this one back.So it was nearly a full four weeks from when I originally got it that it was in my hands in a fully working state, and from what I've seen, this is fast for Acer.Which is a shame - this is a lot of computer for the price. To give credit where it's due, I tested the laptop when it was returned to me and it seemed like the screen problems I was having were completely fixed.Considering the price puts this solidly in the mid-range category, you're getting a lot for what you're paying. It doesn't need an additional harddrive or RAM to be completely viable out of the box. (I bought the 1TB/16GB RAM model.) If you want to add a harddrive, there's a SATA cable in the box, and it's fairly easy to get the back panel off. There's even a tutorial by Acer on YouTube on exactly how to do it.In terms of right-to-repair, though, it's mediocre. It's easy to get to the guts of the computer itself. I'd like having easy access panels for the HDD and RAM, but that's a minor complaint - it's not hard to pry this laptop open.What's disappointing is the mount for the screen. Screens die faster than anything else on a laptop. The way this thing is built, I'm not surprised my screen was defective out of the box. You'll want to always open and close the lid with both hands if you want your screen to last the lifetime of the laptop. If you ever need to change the screen out, it's clearly not designed for you to be able to do so. The bezels aren't as simple to pop open as they are on other units, and the screen is held in place by glue, making it so that you probably want to take it to a technician unless you have some experience doing these kinds of repairs yourself.I wish I could say my experience with this was stellar. I loved my Acer Predator Helios from 2018. I've loved the Aspire I've used for writing documents. I'm just completely unimpressed by Acer's service. Three weeks in and no ETA concerning when the laptop would be back in my hands was unacceptable. They only send you updates when they receive your laptop and when they're sending it back. You can't find out any further details - not even where you're at in the queue.I ended up getting a Lenovo Idea Pad 3 Gaming and so far I am loving it. I can't rate Lenovo's support because I haven't had to contact them. The machine I am using now feels rock solid; much better than I would have expected given the amount of power it has for the price. (Under $800.)With this laptop - it looks like it would be worth it if you get it and it works as intended right out of the box. But - I'm far from the only person who has had an issue with it. They've had build quality problems with the Nitro line all the way through, and there are cases where it took 5-6 weeks for people to get their machines back if they went through Acer's support.With these specs, from the testing I did when I had it hooked up to an external monitor, it performs as beautifully as you'd expect. There is a rock solid machine here if you're careful with the screen and get one that works right out of the box.If you don't?Don't deal with Acer support. Buy a third party warranty if you think you'll ever need it. Buying online, I'd go for something without a lot of reported build problems. This is the kind of laptop that I would buy in person so I could test and immediately replace a defective unit.My trust in Acer is completely shot after this experience. At this point, I'm just glad they got it back to me within the return window. I jumped in because I've had amazing experiences with Acer hardware in the past. Those will probably be my last Acer machines. It's completely unacceptable for a multi-million dollar company to mass produce a line of laptops with a high number of defects and a support process that leaves the buyer in the dark for the majority of it.So - based on build quality, it's a 3 1/2 to 4 star laptop if it works. If it doesn't? You're better off returning it and getting another computer.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

If you're considering this laptop my guess is you're like me in that you dont want to build a pc yourself for whatever reason. I would say this was a fair purchase but if you can wait, i'd say save up a bit more and get a pc built for yourself at microcenter or something. I have played many games and all of them can be played on at least medium settings with no lag. That would include cyberpunk 2077 to give you an idea. I really only have one problem with the laptop and it makes it a bad long term investment. From fully charged, i can only game for maybe 50 minutes. Cant even reach an hour.

Acer Nitro had done great in the past for me. The excellent lifetime given by my previous Nitro 5, i5 Gtx1060  from 2018. Brought me back with established brand confidence.Then it hurt my feelings with deceptive system write ups, misleading access port specs, ect...The short version.This is a whole lot of all the right components forced to live with each other against their will. This laptop is an uncooperative disappointment.All the gripes:I picked this model specifically for its Thunderbolt 4 USB C Display Adapter Port and was thrilled about the RTX3060 GPU.It took 20 hours of setup (WTF seriously) to find out that besides all the issues that would have made it a defective return anyhow, the Display Port is hard wired to the Intel HD on-board graphics processor. It is built to fail on that point.This system has issues built into it in ways that boggle your bogs. The screen had 7 to 8 light discoloration areas around the edges like it had been beaten on from the inside. The new power cord design is something I hope they have fixed in 2023. My experience was it caused power failures when moved while plugged in.  Sudden total power failures, it was like to a blackout.Speaking of feedback, the audio on board sends back slight popping sounds.  Digital distortions from all operations and outputs was intermittent; it does seem consistent as reported by other owners of this model. Some speculation whether this is a new WinOS build issue.If you are a VR user just looking to occasionally link to a laptop, find another. It is possible but the performance of the  RTX3060 in this systems build is surprisingly dismal. At midrange settings, no ray tracing, CP2077 (Cyberpunk 2077) was not able to hold 15 FPS for any interaction beyond the menu screen. The RTX GPU and the CPU share a studio apt with inadequate airflow. It heats up fast and ""The GPU Little Dual Fans that Could"" can't . Why they even let this build go into manufacture is beyond me. This machine cannot keep baseline operating temperature while watching a Movie. This is actually the first time in 13 years of having a laptop as a critical tool of my trade that I even noticed they had any fans. I always just gave them proper ventilation. You will notice these fans thiugh, when the 95 to 110 degree air starts blasting from all possible routes. This is the GPU warning you that an "" Emergency Safety Shutdown"" is about to occur because you are playing Fortnite or whatever. This was the only helpful unintended feature. I found I had about 15 to 20 seconds to save my game or work. By the time I figured out that workflow hack, I finally admitted to myself that I had been naive and was being stubborn trying to create work arounds and validate the value of my purchase.If you are the kind of person who enjoys taking badly designed hardware platforms and tinkering with them you found a deal here..Cyberware PC, ASUS, NITRO have done well by me for the 3 previous workstations I have built on their bare bones. My 2018 Nitro 5 survived, falls, collisions and was even stepped on (In my bag) and made a cracking noise that brought so many simultaneous gasps in a room full of technicians that you could feel the air leaving the room.So please don't let this lengthy review of this one product turn you away from the brand. It has been solid so far.Goodbye 2018 Nitro 5 you were a adequate tool and a  nobel machine.R.I.P.  ""MiniPrime""2018-2023 Death by Winter Storm  😭 Like tears in Rain,,I found it next an open window after a storm, in a puddle.Waaaah!If you read this whole thing, thanks I guess.

I use 3D modeling and game engine programs like Unity, 3DsMax, Blender, Photoshop, and Unreal. I also play plenty of MMORGs and Steam games in my (very little) free-time. And I really needed a new work/personal gaming laptop as my last Acer Predator was starting to degrade after several years of constant use. So I decided to try the Nitro since I really liked the Predator and have an Acer monitor as well.So here's my thoughts:DISPLAYThis is something very important to me being an artist. And the colors are accurate and vivid. I don't have any issue editing my art as I switch displays. It can also get quite bright, nothing too eye burning (I keep it on the lower side) and the screen itself is quite large, and visible even from 2 feet away on a desk.PROCESSOR SPEED / RAM / GPUUsing Unity and Unreal, this laptop has been able to handle my beefy VFX work without issue. Same with my of my 3D Modeling and 3D Sculpting work which can be quite demanding on the GPU. Although the RAM is on the low-medium side so I will be looking into getting an additional one so things run a little faster.STORAGEI upgraded on hard-drive storage when it came to this laptop and I'm so glad I have. All those programs I listed above + PC games can take up a lot of space and I have not had an issue needing to delete something in order to do something else.HARDWARE DESIGNIts nice, sleek, and simple. Very similar to the 2018 Predator I have. The keyboard does light up, which I always like but you can not program custom colors (which is no issue for me but good to know). The only other thing is that this is a LARGE laptop. It is larger than my last one and I really like it being this size for the display. It luckily does fit in my laptop bag but I would make sure to measure yours to make sure this will work for you.PRICEBuying a laptop will always be an expense, especially a gaming laptop. But for the storage space, display quality, and RAM, this laptop is a great deal for $1,200.FINAL THOUGHTSIts been 2 months since Ive been using this laptop and I have had a great experience. Gamer or Artist, I would definitely recommend.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars"

However the laptop is not CRU compliment or customer replacement unit parts. To access the spot to add an extra SSD or RAM the ENTIRE back must be removed. And to add an extra SSD requires using the supplied ribbon, however my black ribbon lock fell into the computer so I can't add an extra SSD.A tip, if you want the red keyboard backlight to remain on while in use the setting is in the BIOS.Overall the performance of the laptop for the cost is very much worth buying. So yes I recommend it. However if you intend to add an extra SSD or RAM, better have someone with lots of experience and tiny fingers.

Bird","I bought this laptop for my son's 16th birthday. It arrived and my son opened it. He was so excited and then the laptop wouldn't turn on. We thought maybe it needs to be plugged in and charge for a bit. He plugged it in, the charging light came on and it still wouldn't turn on. No sound, no lights, nothing. We waited another couple hours, the orange charging light turned to blue and we tried again.....still nothing. Brand new, straight out of the box and it wouldn't work. I had to then contact customer support and I had to mail this brand new computer to Texas for a technician to work on. Now we have to wait for them to look at it and figure out what is wrong with it and ship it back. So, my experience so far is not great.Update - Finally received the computer back from the technician. It took about 4 days to get there, 3 days for them to fix it, and then 4 to send it back. This was quicker than I expected. There was a cable that wasn't connected right inside, which they fixed. The computer is fast and my son has enjoyed it the last day he has had it. So far, it is a decent computer but who knows what will happen as time goes on. I am giving 3 stars for the aggravation of it not working when we first got it. I will update if the computer exceeds expectations after my son has used it for a little while.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars"
