"22","Skirt","Urban CoCo Women's Basic Versatile Stretchy Flared Casual Mini Skater Skirt","Jacky","I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and a size 14-16 in pants, weighing 215lbs. Usually a 2x when wearing tops. I brought a size XL because that was the biggest size they had for the red wine colored skirt. The XXL was out of stock, but I desperately was in a rush for a holiday vaca. It was a bit tight on me, wanted to wear it like a two piece with a crop top but couldn‚Äôt because it didnt look flattering around the waist with the tightness going on. Overall the skirt looks nice and flowy. Not too long, not too short. Right above the knee, but over the thighs. Just the right length. Very nice quality. I thought I could get away with downing a size since I really needed the skirt, but I fooled myself and that‚Äôs my fault. In the end, I couldn‚Äôt wear it with a crop top. Although it does have some type of stretchy-ness to the waistband, it won‚Äôt be enough stretch for you to get away with downing a size. If you‚Äôre around my weight, you‚Äôre better off with a size XXL! Still great product though! Just wish my size wasn‚Äôt out of stock.  :(Update: I brought another skirt and this time in XXL and I love it! Worth the money! I would say this would fit up to size 18 in pants, but wouldn‚Äôt recommend anything above an 18 unless they have an XXXL. Hope this helps my plus size ladies! :)This would definitely be a flattering look for girls of all sizes. Just putting in a review for the girls who think they want to sizedown! Don‚Äôt!!

The pictures don‚Äôt make the skirt look great because my husband took them (he‚Äôs not good at taking pictures) but trust me it‚Äôs really cute.One piece of advice, if you are taller than 5 feet be aware that the skirt is short! Being under 5 feet the Small size which I purchased was not too far along from my bottom.

"34","Skirt","Urban CoCo Women's Basic Versatile Stretchy Flared Casual Mini Skater Skirt","Adelynn","The skirt was cute but the waistband was uneven and overly wide. Because it went well with a top I had, I took off the waistband and sewed it back on so that it was only as wide as the elastic (an inch or so). It looks much better now especially because I don't have a long torso. Fabric has a bit of a crepe texture to it. I like it after altering it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 December 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Good for work, great socially if that's your jam. High quality fabric and make, but I do wish the elastic waistband was the full width of the waistband you see (it is thinner). I got a large (5'9"", 175ish, larger in my legs)- it totally fit and wasn't sliding, but I may have gotten away with a medium and it would have been a little shorter but tighter around my waist. Super cute and flowy, a good staple for a wardrobe.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 15 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"80","Skirt","Urban CoCo Women's Basic Versatile Stretchy Flared Casual Mini Skater Skirt","Kemistry","Super cute skirt. For reference I am a little under 4‚Äô11 and the skirt was a bit short but not short enough to show everything if I had to bend over. The pictures don‚Äôt make the skirt look great because my husband took them (he‚Äôs not good at taking pictures) but trust me it‚Äôs really cute.One piece of advice, if you are taller than 5 feet be aware that the skirt is short! Being under 5 feet the Small size which I purchased was not too far along from my bottom. But then again, not all bodies are the same so you be the judge.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 8 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"84","Skirt","Urban CoCo Women's Basic Versatile Stretchy Flared Casual Mini Skater Skirt","Adelynn","The skirt was cute but the waistband was uneven and overly wide. Because it went well with a top I had, I took off the waistband and sewed it back on so that it was only as wide as the elastic (an inch or so). It looks much better now especially because I don't have a long torso. Fabric has a bit of a crepe texture to it. I like it after altering it.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 21 December 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

This is a great skirt.I have one just like it in white and love them both.I used to be teeny tiny so A small or medium would fit comfortably. I'm 55 And I was 115 pounds. NowI have no idea what my weight is,  I just had a baby and I got large which fits well but probably could've gotten with XL without looking too big. It's all about comfort now lol","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 17 December 2018","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"92","Skirt","Urban CoCo Women's Basic Versatile Stretchy Flared Casual Mini Skater Skirt","Jacky","I got the long length in black and floral, which is pretty long (I am 5'9"" with long legs and the long was barely above my knees when the waist was around my belly button). Good for work, great socially if that's your jam. High quality fabric and make, but I do wish the elastic waistband was the full width of the waistband you see (it is thinner). I got a large (5'9"", 175ish, larger in my legs)- it totally fit and wasn't sliding, but I may have gotten away with a medium and it would have been a little shorter but tighter around my waist. Super cute and flowy, a good staple for a wardrobe.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 15 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
