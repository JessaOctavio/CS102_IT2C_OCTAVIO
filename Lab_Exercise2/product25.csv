"9","T-shirt","Russell Athletic Womens Essential Short Sleeve T-Shirt","KAM","I absolutely love working out in the Russell Athletic Women's Cotton Performance T-Shirt. The cotton material provides a comfortable and natural feel against my skin, making it my go-to for exercise sessions. The soft fabric is a major plus, contributing to an overall pleasant wearing experience.However, there's one noticeable downside – the tightness in the shoulders. During arm workouts, I find myself having to hike up the shirt to avoid feeling restricted. I have this in gray and black, both have the same issue. It's a bit frustrating and affects the overall convenience of the T-shirt. Considering this, I would recommend potential buyers to be mindful of the shoulder fit and perhaps consider sizing up for a more comfortable workout experience.On a positive note, the moisture-wicking properties of the fabric are impressive. The T-shirt effectively keeps me dry, even during intense sweat sessions - without the stench from other workout shirts. I appreciate the simplicity of the design, making it versatile for both the gym and casual wear.Despite the shoulder issue, I continue to reach for this T-shirt for its comfort and breathability. The price cannot be beat! It's become a staple in my workout wardrobe, but I hope the brand addresses the shoulder tightness in future designs. If you prioritize the natural feel of cotton during workouts and don't mind a bit of shoulder tightness, this T-shirt is worth considering.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 1 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
