"2","Phone Case","Miracase Magnetic for iPhone 15 Pro Max Case 6.7'' [Compatible with Magsafe] Full-Body Drop Proof Bumper Phone Case for iPhone 15 Pro Max with Built-in 9H Tempered Glass Screen Protector,Blue","Funktron","Great case that protects your phone well without being super bulky. I’ve dropped my phone on asphalt, concrete, tile, on rocks and many other had surfaces that would have damaged it. But this case has proven to be extremely durable and kept my phone from receiving any damage. It also works very well when it comes to wireless charging. The speed of charging isn’t restricted and the magnetic part sticks really well. I use a wireless charger in my vehicle and have only had it come off the charger when there was a super aggressive bump that seemed like it should have popped tires on my vehicle.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"3","Phone Case","Miracase Magnetic for iPhone 15 Pro Max Case 6.7'' [Compatible with Magsafe] Full-Body Drop Proof Bumper Phone Case for iPhone 15 Pro Max with Built-in 9H Tempered Glass Screen Protector,Blue","Elias","I recently got the Miracase Glass Series Designed for iPhone 14 for my new phone, and I have to say, it's been a great investment. The case itself is top-notch quality, and I was impressed by how easy it was to install, thanks to the clear instructions and helpful video that came with it. One feature I appreciate is the camera protector, which adds an extra layer of protection for my phone's camera. However, I did find it a bit tricky to install that part smoothly. Despite that minor hiccup, I'm extremely satisfied with the case overall. While it's a bit on the pricey side, I genuinely believe it's worth every penny for the quality and added protection it provides.

I had my phone for at least 2 years now and just bought the second case as the screen started to crack with many drops and falls. My phone however, not a scratch!!

After I made the purchase I got a thank you letter as well as an offer to help out with anything I need with use or feedback. And that was before the product arrived. I found that so odd, but so nice.Then the product comes. Haha…not only is it exactly as advertised and a great item but they provided almost comically good directions for putting it together, as well as some cute stickers for…I suppose just to make you smile.And the directions were even better bc they had some colloquialisms and slang in there due to I imagine translation issues.Hey…it’s just an iPhone case, I get it. But in a world where everyone is angry, products are getting worse due to quality issues (hidden inflation of the past few decades), and everyone is quick to complain, it is nice to raise the banner for people doing it right.Great great work iPhone case people!Even though I have buyers remorse for buying blue when I think I should’ve bought black, I am one happy customer!! :)Fantastic case. Just buy it. Take the win.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

You always wonder about the quality of an offbrand phone case. But I decided to go ahead and give this one a try real glad I did. A couple of days ago I slipped fell down went boom, and my wife screams you broke your iPhone. As you could see from the photograph, it busted the heck out of the side of the case, but the iPhone was perfectly intact. Ordered another case right away. The only thing negative that I could say about it was that I couldn’t use facial recognition while it was in the case. Go figure huh. 😜  The new case arrived today and I immediately took my phone out of the old case, and put it in the new case. And now I’m good to go! I really wish I could give the thing higher the five stars because like I said it did everything they said it was going to do.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Paul Allen level business card.

The design of this case is well thought out and provides excellent protection for my smartphone. The snug fit ensures my phone is shielded from accidental drops, bumps, and scratches without compromising on the device's functionality. The case also offers a good grip, reducing the chances of it slipping from my hands.I did encounter a minor hiccup when my first case arrived with some damage, but the customer service team was incredibly responsive and efficient. Upon contacting them by email with a couple pics of the damage, they promptly sent a replacement without any hassle. This level of customer service is commendable and adds an extra layer of satisfaction to the overall buying experience.In conclusion, I highly recommend this phone case to anyone looking for a cost-effective alternative to brands like OtterBox.

That is not the “case” (sorry, I like puns). I have dropped my phone often because I am clumsy and this has held up great!

"33","Phone Case","ESR for iPhone 15 Pro Max Case, Compatible with MagSafe, Military-Grade Protection, Yellowing Resistant, Scratch-Resistant Back, Magnetic Phone Case for iPhone 15 Pro Max, Classic Series, Clear","Desiree Michelle","3/1/24 Below is my original review and this update is based on a replacement case I received from the company.  It’s true I was not pleased with the type of case o originally ordered due to its lack of protection & durability.  Lenka reached out and offered a refund and the option to try a different case-one with a clear back, tougher durable silicone around the edges & with MagSafe.  I am beyond happy with the new case.  The silicone edges are much more durable and dust does not stick to it.  The clear back shows off the beautiful black titanium phone and the case fits rather snug but not too much that makes it difficult to remove.  And they sent the black color which I love-I’m not big on flashy colors.  So props to the seller for making sure their customers are happy.  I already own two different ESR phone windshield mounts-both MagSafe but one with wireless charging and one without so I can plug the phone into my cars data port.  My son has an older car so I wanted one he could just toss on and start charging.  Thank you for looking out for your customers!Let’s start with the positive-very soft silicone material that has a good grip to it, MagSafe works well, good protection around the camera lenses.  I actually liked it until I put it on my phone.  The area around the charging port is extremely flimsy and I can tell it will be ripped in no time.  I have found this to be a problem in many cases I’ve tried.  I just can’t be bothered to return it.  I’ll use it until my Totallee cases come in.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

It was the right color combination that I wanted and it looks great on my phone. I also read the reviews and watched the videos on if it was compatible with the popsocket grips and it looked very promising. It arrived quickly and was nicely packaged. I snapped it onto my phone and it was easy installation. I also like the fact that if I need to take off the case, it comes off easily than other ones that I have had over the years. It adds great protection for what I need and I've dropped it a few times and so far no scratches or dents on the case. I like that it has raised bumpers on the corners and it also has a phone accessory holes on the lower left hand side. I can't remember the last time I've had that on a phone case! I am also happy that the magnetic grip is very strong as they state to the point that I have to pry off my popsocket to remove it. Guaranteed to hold and not just fall off. Overall, I love it.

I was really paying attention to the lip and case around the camera. Some brands are flush with the camera and therefore make me feel as though my lenses are exposed to drops. This one has the lip coming above the lenses. Example, if you run your finger across the back of the case, you’ll hit the bump that borders the camera. I love this. I feel more protected. The MagSafe magnet is super strong and holds my MagSafe popsocket strongly in place. I’ve dropped my phone already a couple times and so far so good. Note: I have tempered glass on the front and back and camera lense covers, and this case. Safety first! I would repurchase and recommend.

Definitely give it a shot","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Just the way I like it. Not too bulky. Keeps the slim feel and look of the phone. I really appreciate the three free stickers. It came with the two seen here and another one that I already put on my phone. It’s a picture of a soup can and it says “You Can do it.” And the fact that they sent two screen protectors along with a double set of everything you need to install it. I also like that the case protects the camera lenses that stick out. My last case didn’t do this and my lenses were cracked. Highly recommend this case. Great for the price.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2024","4.6 out of 5 stars"

This case is feels good, looks good and provides a good amount of basic protection. The stand is a nice bonus. It’s well constructed so doesn’t seem like it will loosen or break. I don’t use it often… mostly because I forget it’s there.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Anyway, I would 1000% buy again. Its very slim but has a nice firm “squish” to it. Also covers the areas between the cameras that usually gets dusty and gross with other cases and an extra depth at the camera lenses to prevent scratching. Came with two screen protectors and some cute stickers.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Always have a set of these on hand.  Cuz you never know when your phone is gonna go down of stairs.  HeheLet’s just say that my phones get stress tested daily. lol.  I’ve had the entire protector obliterated a few times….  And guess what?  When I peel off the War torn screen protector, the phone screen remains in pristine condition!  It’s as if I’m not even accident prone.  😂Tocol’s cases and especially screen protectors are  essential for me to keep these 2k 🙄 phones long lasting physically! And internally as well.

It even has raised edges around the cameras which a lot of phone cases don’t have.
