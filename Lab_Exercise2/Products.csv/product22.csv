"8","T-shirt","GAP Women's 2-Pack Crewneck Favorite Tee T-Shirt","Harry","The T shirt has a cute flattering fit.  I do prefer a narrower ""trim"" to finish a collar so that it is a more feminine tee, but no biggie.  I would prefer a cotton/poly mix over the modal so that it is washable/dryable and durable.  Modal makes it soft but not durable.  I do not favor see-through tees and this is a little too thin.  If you like the details of your bra to shine through (ie patterns, flowers, etc...) then this tee is for you.  I thought I would try this tee due to its ratings, and it is okay.  I would truly rate it a 3 and 1/2 stars.  I washed once in cold and dried flat and it shrunk lengthwise, if this were a quality long fiber cotton, it shouldn't have shrunk this much.  Not sure why that happened at all.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 31 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
