I first bought one of these a year ago and was very pleased with the skirt.  It’s a nice light weight, but not sheer, making them drape nicely and flowy.  I now own three of them and excited to for nicer weather to wear them.  I like quality clothing but think it’s unnecessary to spend a lot of money, I’m not a ‘label’ person.

I’m so pleasantly surprised that everything about it I love. The colors are really vibrant even after a hand wash cycle (hung dry). It still felt soft after the wash and it wasn’t so wrinkly that you couldn’t wear it. I steamed mine a little to see if there was a different look (really didn’t make a huge difference). Also I’m 5’6 and it didn’t shrink. There is a lot of stretch in the elastic band that I kinda think I could had gotten a small instead of the medium. However the strings are functional so I kept the medium.Some of the reviews mentioned a mermaid fit. I really didn’t think there was a huge mermaid fit (my opinion but could be my body type). In the one picture I have you can see that I stretched my legs out and it didn’t cut into my legs. There’s only a hint of that mermaid fit and it’s right at the first ruffle. This skirt is really flowy. It moves with your body. I didn’t think it was see through and I was standing in the sunlight in one of those pictures. The fabric is really light weight that it can be worn in the spring and summer which I’ll be doing since I live in the south.

In the picture the skirt flows freely and in the description it is supposed to be relaxed and a-line, but in reality it is exactly what other people are describing: a kind of modified ""mermaid-style"" in that it is fitted closely at the thighs at the first ruffle line.

"26","Skirt","ZESICA Women's 2023 Bohemian Floral Printed Elastic Waist A Line Maxi Skirt with Pockets","JB","Let’s work this out together, Amazon friends...I ordered an XL in the color “purple”. I am a curvy size 14 in most jeans. I wear L in most leggings. I carry my bulk in my hips and rear.The colors:As you can see in my image the skirt I received is different from not only the skirt pictured in another review but also different from the one pictured by the seller. The skirt I received is pink in the background and blue where there should be purple. Nice colors, sure. But not the colors I ordered, you dig?The fit:Truthfully it fits as it should, flowy and pretty. It’s not snug for me. BUT it’s not wearable because the pockets are not deep and don’t hang properly so they stick out. Making your hips appear larger. I don’t need that in my life.Also my skirt has a little ruffle sewn in where the top hem meets the bottom hem of the dress and it’s sewn upsidedown. An upsidedown ruffle. Just looks odd. So odd.  I already wear enough odd stuff. I wanted this to be one of my “nice” pieces of clothing!In short - purchase if you’re into living dangerously and are cool w getting random things sent to you! I’m sending mine back. ✌️","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 30 May 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It does cut in shape-wise on the first ruffle about mid thigh, and the pockets kind of stick out which  made my hips stick out/look rounder...but for whatever reason, this color and size was half the price of the others, so I'm keeping it.

However, I needed a red skirt for an event in April and didn't want to spend very much.  I'm actually very happy with this skirt and will definitely wear it more than the one time I planned.  It is a little thin, so warmer weather is a must.  It is not see-through at all, though.  It is very pretty and not too long on me.  The fit is very flattering and it's easy to wear almost any kind of top with it, tucked or untucked - both ways work well.  I would say it runs a bit smaller than what the size chart says.  I ordered a medium, but if I would have gotten my actual size, it would have been a small.  I could not imagine a small working very well for this skirt, however.  For reference, I am 5'9"" , 140 pounds.  I normally wear a 4 or 6, but in this skirt I wear the 8-10 (M).

The background is kind of a dirty white and not pink.  It is not very full.  I normally wear a size 8 and ordered a large for more fullness.  For reference, if I pull it to one side there is about 4"" of fabric.  It's very thin and a bit sheer.  There is a weird seam across the middle of the thigh that makes it tighter there.  For $9.99 I'll still wear it, but it's not the flowy , boho skirt that is pictured.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 26 July 2019","2.0 out of 5 stars"

"76","Skirt","ZESICA Women's 2023 Bohemian Floral Printed Elastic Waist A Line Maxi Skirt with Pockets","JB","Let’s work this out together, Amazon friends...I ordered an XL in the color “purple”. I am a curvy size 14 in most jeans. I wear L in most leggings. I carry my bulk in my hips and rear.The colors:As you can see in my image the skirt I received is different from not only the skirt pictured in another review but also different from the one pictured by the seller. The skirt I received is pink in the background and blue where there should be purple. Nice colors, sure. But not the colors I ordered, you dig?The fit:Truthfully it fits as it should, flowy and pretty. It’s not snug for me. BUT it’s not wearable because the pockets are not deep and don’t hang properly so they stick out. Making your hips appear larger. I don’t need that in my life.Also my skirt has a little ruffle sewn in where the top hem meets the bottom hem of the dress and it’s sewn upsidedown. An upsidedown ruffle. Just looks odd. So odd.  I already wear enough odd stuff. I wanted this to be one of my “nice” pieces of clothing!In short - purchase if you’re into living dangerously and are cool w getting random things sent to you! I’m sending mine back. ✌️","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 30 May 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars"

However, I needed a red skirt for an event in April and didn't want to spend very much.  I'm actually very happy with this skirt and will definitely wear it more than the one time I planned.  It is a little thin, so warmer weather is a must.  It is not see-through at all, though.  It is very pretty and not too long on me.  The fit is very flattering and it's easy to wear almost any kind of top with it, tucked or untucked - both ways work well.  I would say it runs a bit smaller than what the size chart says.  I ordered a medium, but if I would have gotten my actual size, it would have been a small.  I could not imagine a small working very well for this skirt, however.  For reference, I am 5'9"" , 140 pounds.  I normally wear a 4 or 6, but in this skirt I wear the 8-10 (M).  I like this enough that I'm going to order another one!","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
