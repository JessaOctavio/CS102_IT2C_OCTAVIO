The strap and feeling of the bag on my back are comfortable during long wears. I really like the small pocket on the back of the bag that rests against your back when wearing. 100% worth the price and 10/10 recommend, looks great with anything you wear.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I was able to carry all I needed plus our passports a spare phone charger I even stuffed a scarf in there at one point and still had room to take my husbands sunglasses when he wasn’t wearing them. I went back to a regular crossbody after we were home and thought…..why? That bag was perfect for everything so I’m going to buy it in a few colors. It’s a little oversized for what I need but it’s refreshing to not have a bag overstuffed.

"22","Sling Bag","VADOO Sling Bag - Anti-theft Crossbody Shoulder Bag for Men and Women (Black)","Kindle Customer","Got the OG Black V1 version of this item.  Lots of pockets with zippers, and a magnetic strap on top for easier access.  You can fit a phone, kindle, and passport sized documents into it no problem.The bag slings over your left shoulder, to allow your right hand to reach it easily.  Being water resistant, it traps in both heat and sweat -- something to note for vigorous activities.  I am considerably warmer wearing this thing than not when going outdoors.This fits under a jacket easily, and a passerby won't notice it with just a phone and some documents.Another review said this thing can fit a pistol, and I think that's accurate.  You probably don't want people mistake it for a holster as you reach for items inside your jacket.  Just something to note.Overall, a good travel bag.  Been sturdy from the usages I've had in the past week.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I liked the multiple compartments to keep things separate.  For the price I was surprised at it's quality.  The only part I didn't like was the top pocket having a loop instead of zippers, if you have to sling it around stuff can fall out, but not a deal breaker, I just didn't use that pocket.  I think it might be a visual target if traveling to a place with lots of pickpockets, so I might try wearing it under my t-shirt when I travel to Italy.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

The downside to that is the smaller size and lack of individual compartments. I don't want to unzip the bag to get cash out only to see my car keys fall out. When I travel I like being able to have just my travel day necessities easy to access....phone, money/cards, passport, boarding passes, airpods, etc. Especially with kids, the last thing I want to be doing is stopping to rummage through a backpack.My lulu bag served me well but I've been looking for something a little bigger, that isn't too bulky, but has separate compartments. This bag is honestly perfect. I was super impressed with the quality for the price point. So far I've only been carrying it around town, but will be flying internationally with it soon. I've been able to fit my cash/cards in the back zippered section, and the front two sections have plenty of space for sunglasses, phone, keys, etc. I've been able to fit an small pack of wipes, an extra pair of thin pants for my potty training toddler, and my sunglasses all in the larger section of the pouch with no problems.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
