"10","Shoes","Crocs Unisex Adult Classic Clog","Ryan Wahlstrom","This one has some holes around the rim(?) which could be good or bad. It will be good as air comes in the feet area so water will be dried quickly. However, when you go to beach, sand will goes into the feet area. Happy as it is.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 5 March 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars"

"19","Shoes","Crocs Unisex Adult Classic Clog","0499776609","I wear size US M15 crocs (pictured right) and comparing them to these crocs (pictured left) these crocs are noticibly smaller in width and slightly smaller in length. Otherwise, they still look like crocs. Noticibly, the older crocs have ""Made in Vietnam"" on the back, while the new crocs have ""Made in China"" so it also could be a quality assurance issue between manufacturing sites.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 31 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"33","Shoes","Crocs Unisex Adult Classic Clog","Baydon moore",". I love the colour (Atmosphere), it goes with everything.. I suffer at present with puffy feet (pregnant) and bought a size up.  I've found this problem before with  Crocs and to go 2 sizes up to WUS11 would be just ridiculous.. Would love it if Crocs would change the texture on the inside of the shoe.  I find after a few minutes my feet start to feel a bit tender (I have very soft feet).  I think a 'wave' would be more comfy for texture than little plastic needles.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 30 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"43","Shoes","Crocs Unisex Adult Classic Clog","Anne","I am a big fan of traditional crocs, and I have had my first pair since 2007, still wearing them a lot and they are beautifully soft and supportive. Got the new pair yesterday and wore them most of the day. Not as soft as the oldies, but I don't think it will take too long to wear them in.I recommend going up a size for Australian feet,as the translation from US sizes makes these a bit snug and fine with bare feet but no room as yet for my winter socks.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 16 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"50","Shoes","Crocs Unisex Adult Classic Clog","Canadianpam","I have been wearing a pair of Crocs almost every day for more than 5 years now. After a while they lose their grip on smooth surfaces, so be careful. I just bought another pair to wear exclusively around the house, and will continue using the old ones for everywhere else. Maybe 10 ""special"" days a year I dress up with shoes and socks. The rest of the year I relax in Crocs.","Verified Purchase","Reviewed in Australia on 21 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
